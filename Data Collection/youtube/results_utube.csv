28,coupe like the new union jack tail,76.159,4.32,zE_iqWzEI44
29,lights,79.92,3.28,zE_iqWzEI44
30,look interesting and with nexon now,80.479,4.241,zE_iqWzEI44
31,written across the rear,83.2,4.48,zE_iqWzEI44
32,it's easy to identify this one as the,84.72,4.24,zE_iqWzEI44
33,facelift,87.68,3.759,zE_iqWzEI44
34,it even gets four vents at the bottom of,88.96,4.24,zE_iqWzEI44
35,the rear bumper to make it look,91.439,5.521,zE_iqWzEI44
36,wider the cabin is more familiar,93.2,8.64,zE_iqWzEI44
37,but still substantially updated,96.96,4.88,zE_iqWzEI44
38,so quite a lot new on the inside first,102.72,3.759,zE_iqWzEI44
39,up is this,105.439,4.0,zE_iqWzEI44
40,dry arrow design that comes right across,106.479,3.92,zE_iqWzEI44
41,the dash,109.439,2.881,zE_iqWzEI44
42,there's this new steering wheel the flat,110.399,4.321,zE_iqWzEI44
43,bottom steering wheel cruise control is,112.32,3.2,zE_iqWzEI44
44,new,114.72,2.8,zE_iqWzEI44

46,digital instrument panel,117.52,5.44,zE_iqWzEI44
47,and a new sunroof,119.119,3.841,zE_iqWzEI44
48,while the build of the dash feels tough,123.52,3.919,zE_iqWzEI44
49,and the buttons are well finished,125.52,4.959,zE_iqWzEI44
50,the oversized drive mode knob is a waste,127.439,3.841,zE_iqWzEI44
51,of space,130.479,3.041,zE_iqWzEI44
52,tata could have easily used it to,131.28,3.12,zE_iqWzEI44
53,install,133.52,3.439,zE_iqWzEI44
54,something practical like a cup holder,134.4,4.0,zE_iqWzEI44
55,strange thing is there still,136.959,4.321,zE_iqWzEI44
56,isn't a secure place to put your phone,138.4,4.4,zE_iqWzEI44
57,there's a lot of hard edges here,141.28,4.24,zE_iqWzEI44
58,it's a tight fit and even when you roll,142.8,3.12,zE_iqWzEI44
59,back,145.52,2.88,zE_iqWzEI44
60,these blinds these roller blinds there's,145.92,3.12,zE_iqWzEI44
61,more,148.4,3.68,zE_iqWzEI44
62,angles and places your phone is likely,149.04,4.08,zE_iqWzEI44
63,to get damaged,152.08,3.439,zE_iqWzEI44
64,so the safest place is to keep it in,153.12,3.44,zE_iqWzEI44
65,your pocket,155.519,4.241,zE_iqWzEI44
66,also both the instrument panel and the,156.56,4.0,zE_iqWzEI44
67,touchscreen,159.76,3.52,zE_iqWzEI44
68,need to be brighter try and reverse in,160.56,3.84,zE_iqWzEI44
69,full sunshine,163.28,3.36,zE_iqWzEI44
70,and it is genuinely difficult to see,164.4,3.119,zE_iqWzEI44
71,obstacles,166.64,3.44,zE_iqWzEI44
72,on the screen still the umbrella holders,167.519,3.201,zE_iqWzEI44
73,in the doors,170.08,3.12,zE_iqWzEI44
74,are a nice touch the big cooled glove,170.72,3.519,zE_iqWzEI44
75,box is,173.2,4.0,zE_iqWzEI44
76,well cool and then there's the even,174.239,3.681,zE_iqWzEI44
77,cooler,177.2,4.08,zE_iqWzEI44
78,express cool function express,177.92,6.16,zE_iqWzEI44
79,cooling on windows may roll down it even,181.28,4.48,zE_iqWzEI44
80,reminds you to put the window,184.08,4.72,zE_iqWzEI44
81,up via a voice prompt when the cabin is,185.76,6.08,zE_iqWzEI44
82,finally cooling nicely the nexon has,188.8,3.76,zE_iqWzEI44
83,always been,191.84,3.44,zE_iqWzEI44
84,a comfortable suv to sit in this in part,192.56,3.84,zE_iqWzEI44
85,is due to the space,195.28,4.239,zE_iqWzEI44
86,efficient design and the ruby wide cabin,196.4,6.24,zE_iqWzEI44
87,and it's pretty good in the rear as well,199.519,5.521,zE_iqWzEI44
88,so surprisingly comfortable in the back,202.64,3.76,zE_iqWzEI44
89,especially due to this,205.04,3.839,zE_iqWzEI44
90,long seat this long swab gives you,206.4,3.919,zE_iqWzEI44
91,tremendous thigh support,208.879,3.44,zE_iqWzEI44
92,there's a fair amount of knee room you,210.319,3.041,zE_iqWzEI44
93,can keep your feet,212.319,3.361,zE_iqWzEI44
94,under the seat you have a vent here for,213.36,4.72,zE_iqWzEI44
95,you and despite the arched roof,215.68,5.119,zE_iqWzEI44
96,there's a decent amount of headroom as,218.08,3.6,zE_iqWzEI44
97,well,220.799,2.72,zE_iqWzEI44
98,there are no usb ports in the back,221.68,3.919,zE_iqWzEI44
99,however and that's something tata could,223.519,3.121,zE_iqWzEI44
100,have fixed,225.599,4.241,zE_iqWzEI44
101,the nexon also gets tata's ira connected,226.64,3.679,zE_iqWzEI44
102,tech,229.84,2.88,zE_iqWzEI44
103,and included in this software suite is,230.319,3.84,zE_iqWzEI44
104,the what three words,232.72,4.079,zE_iqWzEI44
105,navigation aid we didn't manage to test,234.159,4.64,zE_iqWzEI44
106,either however as the various,236.799,5.681,zE_iqWzEI44
107,functions weren't activated,238.799,5.921,zE_iqWzEI44
108,when it comes to kit you also get led,242.48,3.36,zE_iqWzEI44
109,drls both,244.72,3.519,zE_iqWzEI44
110,at the front and the rear you now get,245.84,4.0,zE_iqWzEI44
111,esps sander,248.239,3.92,zE_iqWzEI44
112,there's also traction control rollover,249.84,3.119,zE_iqWzEI44
113,mitigation,252.159,3.841,zE_iqWzEI44
114,brake assist auto wipers auto lights,252.959,6.321,zE_iqWzEI44
115,and tire pressure monitoring luggage,256.0,4.959,zE_iqWzEI44
116,space in the rear is a useful,259.28,4.72,zE_iqWzEI44
117,350 liters and you can fold and flip the,260.959,7.261,zE_iqWzEI44
118,seats down as well,264.0,7.729,zE_iqWzEI44
119,[Music],268.22,3.509,zE_iqWzEI44
120,tata's 1.2 petrol may be a three,272.88,3.039,zE_iqWzEI44
121,cylinder engine,275.12,2.799,zE_iqWzEI44
122,but the only time you can really tell is,275.919,4.401,zE_iqWzEI44
123,when you fire it up,277.919,5.201,zE_iqWzEI44
124,the nexon petrol is also a bit smoother,280.32,4.72,zE_iqWzEI44
125,now,283.12,5.6,zE_iqWzEI44
126,tata have retuned this engine to make it,285.04,6.48,zE_iqWzEI44
127,a bit more powerful and importantly to,288.72,4.24,zE_iqWzEI44
128,make it smoother,291.52,4.32,zE_iqWzEI44
129,the earlier one was extremely snatchy,292.96,5.92,zE_iqWzEI44
130,and here to some small extent,295.84,6.4,zE_iqWzEI44
131,it has succeeded but,298.88,5.52,zE_iqWzEI44
132,it still feels a bit jerky when you get,302.24,7.84,zE_iqWzEI44
133,on and off the throttle,304.4,8.32,zE_iqWzEI44
134,there also is quite some amount of lag,310.08,4.88,zE_iqWzEI44
135,put your foot down at around 1000 rpm,312.72,5.28,zE_iqWzEI44
136,and you have to wait till well over 2000,314.96,5.92,zE_iqWzEI44
137,for it to really start pulling,318.0,6.0,zE_iqWzEI44
138,strongly and that at times in,320.88,6.08,zE_iqWzEI44
139,city traffic can be difficult the engine,324.0,4.4,zE_iqWzEI44
140,does a fair job,326.96,4.88,zE_iqWzEI44
141,in the mid-range there is a fair amount,328.4,5.04,zE_iqWzEI44
142,of performance,331.84,4.56,zE_iqWzEI44
143,in the mid-range and if you keep it,333.44,3.599,zE_iqWzEI44
144,there,336.4,4.0,zE_iqWzEI44
145,the nexon pulls forward quite smartly,337.039,7.681,zE_iqWzEI44
146,but pulling it to the 6000 rpm redline,340.4,8.56,zE_iqWzEI44
147,doesn't really make much sense,344.72,4.24,zE_iqWzEI44
148,it's noisy it feels strained and,349.039,6.241,zE_iqWzEI44
149,the amount of extra performance you gain,352.56,3.28,zE_iqWzEI44
150,isn't,355.28,4.16,zE_iqWzEI44
151,all that much question is can you feel,355.84,6.72,zE_iqWzEI44
152,the additional 10 horsepower,359.44,5.44,zE_iqWzEI44
153,only at times and if you'd really pay,362.56,3.84,zE_iqWzEI44
154,attention,364.88,4.08,zE_iqWzEI44
155,and let's not forget the nexon is heavy,366.4,4.56,zE_iqWzEI44
156,especially compared to many of its,368.96,3.359,zE_iqWzEI44
157,rivals,370.96,3.92,zE_iqWzEI44
158,the driving modes eco city and sport,372.319,4.401,zE_iqWzEI44
159,work quite well,374.88,4.72,zE_iqWzEI44
160,eco is ok when you want to conserve fuel,376.72,3.84,zE_iqWzEI44
161,and spot,379.6,4.0,zE_iqWzEI44
162,does give you an extra kick while we did,380.56,4.72,zE_iqWzEI44
163,do a performance test,383.6,4.08,zE_iqWzEI44
164,we weren't able to launch the new nexon,385.28,3.12,zE_iqWzEI44
165,cleanly,387.68,2.959,zE_iqWzEI44
166,as the traction control couldn't be,388.4,3.12,zE_iqWzEI44
167,switched off,390.639,4.601,zE_iqWzEI44
168,and as a result to 0-100 came up in,391.52,6.16,zE_iqWzEI44
169,13.01 seconds,395.24,4.36,zE_iqWzEI44
170,ignore the launch however and it clearly,397.68,3.44,zE_iqWzEI44
171,shows this new one,399.6,4.159,zE_iqWzEI44
172,has a bit of an edge over the earlier,401.12,4.96,zE_iqWzEI44
173,110 horsepower version,403.759,4.961,zE_iqWzEI44
174,with the nexon really excels is over,406.08,3.679,zE_iqWzEI44
175,broken roads,408.72,3.68,zE_iqWzEI44
176,you can carry on over bad patches often,409.759,6.0,zE_iqWzEI44
177,without really having to slow down,412.4,6.079,zE_iqWzEI44
178,overall the nexon does round off the,415.759,3.601,zE_iqWzEI44
179,bumps,418.479,4.321,zE_iqWzEI44
180,pretty nicely but there still is,419.36,7.44,zE_iqWzEI44
181,a bit of stiffness in the springs,422.8,6.72,zE_iqWzEI44
182,and over broken patches of road and,426.8,3.6,zE_iqWzEI44
183,large craters,429.52,3.76,zE_iqWzEI44
184,you can feel that what it does however,430.4,4.079,zE_iqWzEI44
185,is give the nexon,433.28,4.16,zE_iqWzEI44
186,good straight line stability and this,434.479,3.601,zE_iqWzEI44
187,delivers,437.44,2.879,zE_iqWzEI44
188,plenty of confidence through to the,438.08,3.28,zE_iqWzEI44
189,steering,440.319,2.481,zE_iqWzEI44
190,the little bit of stiffness in the,441.36,3.2,zE_iqWzEI44
191,suspension helps the nexon,442.8,5.519,zE_iqWzEI44
192,in the handling department too,444.56,3.759,zE_iqWzEI44
193,with its well-weighted steering and,449.36,4.48,zE_iqWzEI44
194,actually decent body control,451.759,7.601,zE_iqWzEI44
195,the nexon feels comfortable at speed,453.84,8.0,zE_iqWzEI44
196,it isn't as agile as something like an,459.36,3.36,zE_iqWzEI44
197,eco sport,461.84,3.199,zE_iqWzEI44
198,but get onto a good road and you can,462.72,3.039,zE_iqWzEI44
199,certainly,465.039,4.16,zE_iqWzEI44
200,enjoy slinging a few corners together,465.759,6.641,zE_iqWzEI44
201,with its uprated and recalibrated engine,469.199,6.241,zE_iqWzEI44
202,the 2020 nexon now feels marginally,472.4,6.72,zE_iqWzEI44
203,peppier and smoother to drive,475.44,6.08,zE_iqWzEI44
204,its beefy suspension does well in our,479.12,3.28,zE_iqWzEI44
205,conditions,481.52,2.88,zE_iqWzEI44
206,it is among the more spacious and,482.4,4.56,zE_iqWzEI44
207,comfortable compact suvs in its class,484.4,4.56,zE_iqWzEI44
208,and with the additional goodies and kit,486.96,4.239,zE_iqWzEI44

210,up market too also with prices ranging,491.199,7.521,zE_iqWzEI44
211,from 6.95 to 11.20 lakh,495.12,6.479,zE_iqWzEI44
212,for the petrol the nexon is still great,498.72,4.24,zE_iqWzEI44
213,value for money,501.599,3.841,zE_iqWzEI44
214,no quality levels still aren't quite the,502.96,3.04,zE_iqWzEI44
215,same as,505.44,3.52,zE_iqWzEI44
216,some rivals and the petrol engine and,506.0,3.84,zE_iqWzEI44

6,Maruti Suzuki where this will be sold,23.519,6.18,bKv2iaWN5pQ
7,because this car is about the LT going,26.039,6.211,bKv2iaWN5pQ

35,a techy feel to them and the high bonnet,104.429,4.561,bKv2iaWN5pQ
36,along with the scuff plates in the front,106.92,6.949,bKv2iaWN5pQ
37,give the excel 6 or more macho stance,108.99,4.879,bKv2iaWN5pQ
38,you have robust scuff plates at the rear,114.36,4.71,bKv2iaWN5pQ
39,too but the SUV look is far from,116.67,5.37,bKv2iaWN5pQ
40,convincing with the LT gas huge MP we,119.07,5.76,bKv2iaWN5pQ
41,like tailgate but it's from the site,122.04,5.16,bKv2iaWN5pQ
42,that the design is really messed up and,124.83,4.02,bKv2iaWN5pQ
43,over those of cladding has knocked the,127.2,4.92,bKv2iaWN5pQ
44,xl6 proportions well for a six and has,128.85,5.52,bKv2iaWN5pQ
45,only served to dwarf the 16 inch wheels,132.12,4.89,bKv2iaWN5pQ
46,which look really puny the design now,134.37,6.0,bKv2iaWN5pQ
47,cries out for 17 inches at least well,137.01,4.8,bKv2iaWN5pQ
48,let's see what the changes are on the,140.37,3.71,bKv2iaWN5pQ
49,inside,141.81,2.27,bKv2iaWN5pQ
50,so the talking point of the xl6,145.98,5.08,bKv2iaWN5pQ
51,are these captain seats which is what,148.9,5.22,bKv2iaWN5pQ
52,makes it a six seater and first,151.06,5.79,bKv2iaWN5pQ
53,impressions very very comfortable,154.12,5.49,bKv2iaWN5pQ
54,lots of under thigh support lower back,156.85,4.83,bKv2iaWN5pQ
55,support is also good you can recline the,159.61,5.13,bKv2iaWN5pQ
56,seat you got a retractable armrests and,161.68,5.49,bKv2iaWN5pQ
57,the overall seating position is,164.74,4.26,bKv2iaWN5pQ
58,absolutely superb because you sit in a,167.17,5.04,bKv2iaWN5pQ
59,slightly elevated way lots of outside,169.0,5.25,bKv2iaWN5pQ
60,visibility these huge windows you can,172.21,5.01,bKv2iaWN5pQ
61,see outside so overall comfort really,174.25,6.54,bKv2iaWN5pQ
62,here is fantastic if anything it doesn't,177.22,5.64,bKv2iaWN5pQ
63,have quite the width of the Innova but,180.79,4.02,bKv2iaWN5pQ
64,don't forget that the crysta is that,182.86,4.5,bKv2iaWN5pQ
65,much more expensive it's in definitely,184.81,5.37,bKv2iaWN5pQ
66,more than a class above but honestly,187.36,5.7,bKv2iaWN5pQ
67,even for large people it's so,190.18,5.67,bKv2iaWN5pQ
68,comfortable in here that for corporates,193.06,6.54,bKv2iaWN5pQ
69,this is a place they could be very very,195.85,9.63,bKv2iaWN5pQ
70,happy the seats trimmed in artificial,199.6,7.8,bKv2iaWN5pQ
71,leather have a nice double stitching and,205.48,3.99,bKv2iaWN5pQ
72,perforated finish and feel pretty,207.4,4.77,bKv2iaWN5pQ
73,upscale for an 11 lacquered MPV the all,209.47,4.739,bKv2iaWN5pQ
74,black interior themes ash wood finished,212.17,3.87,bKv2iaWN5pQ
75,inserts in the dash and the knitted roof,214.209,4.651,bKv2iaWN5pQ
76,liner at to the upmarket feel like in,216.04,4.53,bKv2iaWN5pQ
77,the air tiga you'll be surprised by the,218.86,3.48,bKv2iaWN5pQ
78,space you have in the third row and the,220.57,3.72,bKv2iaWN5pQ
79,adjustable backrest make a world of a,222.34,4.26,bKv2iaWN5pQ
80,difference practicality to is largely,224.29,4.229,bKv2iaWN5pQ
81,unchanged and you have lots of decent,226.6,3.51,bKv2iaWN5pQ
82,storage space throughout the cabin,228.519,3.861,bKv2iaWN5pQ
83,there's a useful underfloor compartment,230.11,4.71,bKv2iaWN5pQ
84,there's room for a couple of bags with,232.38,4.18,bKv2iaWN5pQ
85,all seats in place and that of course,234.82,3.57,bKv2iaWN5pQ
86,multiplies with the third row fold it,236.56,3.27,bKv2iaWN5pQ
87,down but the middle pair of captain,238.39,3.599,bKv2iaWN5pQ
88,seats don't fall like the bench seat in,239.83,4.26,bKv2iaWN5pQ
89,the edging up but what the captain seats,241.989,4.801,bKv2iaWN5pQ
90,do offer is enough room between them to,244.09,4.32,bKv2iaWN5pQ
91,let you wiggle your way to the back,246.79,3.9,bKv2iaWN5pQ
92,which at times is a more convenient way,248.41,5.329,bKv2iaWN5pQ
93,to access the third row,250.69,3.049,bKv2iaWN5pQ
94,the xl6 comes with just one engine,255.94,5.919,bKv2iaWN5pQ
95,option it's a 1.5 litre petrol which,258.769,5.821,bKv2iaWN5pQ
96,develops 105 horsepower it's carried,261.859,4.891,bKv2iaWN5pQ
97,straight off the air tiga but what is,264.59,4.079,bKv2iaWN5pQ
98,not carried over from the air tiga is,266.75,5.43,bKv2iaWN5pQ
99,the 1.5 diesel it's a shame that that,268.669,6.181,bKv2iaWN5pQ
100,fabulous 1.5 diesel does not make it,272.18,4.859,bKv2iaWN5pQ
101,into this car and a lot of you must be,274.85,3.39,bKv2iaWN5pQ
102,wondering why,277.039,2.94,bKv2iaWN5pQ
103,well there are fundamentally two reasons,278.24,5.76,bKv2iaWN5pQ
104,its cost and bandwidth because even when,279.979,6.151,bKv2iaWN5pQ
105,you have to put a diesel engine and not,284.0,4.259,bKv2iaWN5pQ
106,put any engine into a car like this it,286.13,4.879,bKv2iaWN5pQ
107,means it has to be recalibrated,288.259,5.34,bKv2iaWN5pQ
108,validation has to be done that's a,291.009,5.201,bKv2iaWN5pQ
109,costly affair and that takes up a lot of,293.599,5.431,bKv2iaWN5pQ
110,time and everyone knows marty is gonna,296.21,4.53,bKv2iaWN5pQ
111,be exiting the diesel segment so the,299.03,4.08,bKv2iaWN5pQ
112,company feels that just for a couple of,300.74,4.89,bKv2iaWN5pQ
113,months it's just not works that effort,303.11,5.279,bKv2iaWN5pQ
114,and cost to put a diesel engine in here,305.63,4.469,bKv2iaWN5pQ
115,really a shame because that is a,308.389,3.84,bKv2iaWN5pQ
116,fabulous diesel engine,310.099,6.511,bKv2iaWN5pQ
117,but this 1.5 petrol is now gone to be a,312.229,6.271,bKv2iaWN5pQ
118,6 because that's what North is working,316.61,3.51,bKv2iaWN5pQ
119,on it's converting all this engines to,318.5,5.25,bKv2iaWN5pQ
120,be a 6 and this bs6 engine quite frankly,320.12,5.609,bKv2iaWN5pQ
121,it doesn't feel very different from the,323.75,4.44,bKv2iaWN5pQ
122,earlier LT gar it's been calibrated,325.729,5.06,bKv2iaWN5pQ
123,really well it's a smooth power delivery,328.19,5.37,bKv2iaWN5pQ
124,very linear power delivery the only,330.789,5.261,bKv2iaWN5pQ
125,issue is that it's got that same flat,333.56,4.919,bKv2iaWN5pQ
126,mid-range there's really no punch in the,336.05,4.47,bKv2iaWN5pQ
127,mid-range and that's why when you want,338.479,3.781,bKv2iaWN5pQ
128,to overtake on the highway you can't,340.52,3.389,bKv2iaWN5pQ
129,just put your foot down and it just goes,342.26,4.5,bKv2iaWN5pQ
130,forward effortlessly you need to shift,343.909,6.181,bKv2iaWN5pQ
131,down and you know floor it a bit so it's,346.76,5.76,bKv2iaWN5pQ
132,it's that's really the downside of this,350.09,4.319,bKv2iaWN5pQ
133,petrol but it's otherwise smooth and,352.52,5.49,bKv2iaWN5pQ
134,also it loves to be revved in fact you,354.409,6.44,bKv2iaWN5pQ
135,push it hard it takes a bit of a nice,358.01,5.89,bKv2iaWN5pQ
136,throaty not you know it sounds,360.849,9.261,bKv2iaWN5pQ
137,and it sounds pretty good I like it yes,363.9,7.92,bKv2iaWN5pQ
138,you do need to rev this engine to get,370.11,3.3,bKv2iaWN5pQ
139,the most out of it and you missed that,371.82,3.84,bKv2iaWN5pQ
140,surge of power in the mid-range which,373.41,4.95,bKv2iaWN5pQ
141,only a turbo engine gives you but for,375.66,5.1,bKv2iaWN5pQ
142,regular commuting this engine more than,378.36,4.1,bKv2iaWN5pQ
143,does the job,380.76,4.2,bKv2iaWN5pQ
144,so I've jumped into the automatic,382.46,4.69,bKv2iaWN5pQ
145,variant of the excel six which uses the,384.96,4.89,bKv2iaWN5pQ
146,same four speed auto carried over from,387.15,3.63,bKv2iaWN5pQ
147,the El Tigre,389.85,3.39,bKv2iaWN5pQ
148,it's a torque converter it's quite an,390.78,5.91,bKv2iaWN5pQ
149,old-school automatic so a bit lazy in,393.24,8.19,bKv2iaWN5pQ
150,its responses and it works best on our,396.69,6.78,bKv2iaWN5pQ
151,throttle you know where it can just,401.43,5.04,bKv2iaWN5pQ
152,amble along and you know as a family car,403.47,5.04,bKv2iaWN5pQ
153,in the city the xl6,406.47,4.98,bKv2iaWN5pQ
154,auto wood is pretty good actually and,408.51,7.11,bKv2iaWN5pQ
155,even when you floor it kick down is is,411.45,5.1,bKv2iaWN5pQ
156,pretty okay,415.62,4.17,bKv2iaWN5pQ
157,it's just that with four gears it,416.55,5.85,bKv2iaWN5pQ
158,doesn't make the maximum use of this,419.79,5.55,bKv2iaWN5pQ
159,engines power and talk and even,422.4,5.85,bKv2iaWN5pQ
160,efficiency obviously won't be as good as,425.34,7.17,bKv2iaWN5pQ
161,a manual or a DCT or even AMD Auto for,428.25,6.56,bKv2iaWN5pQ
162,that matter,432.51,2.3,bKv2iaWN5pQ
163,I'm back in the manual variant which I,436.99,3.579,bKv2iaWN5pQ
164,prefer,440.18,2.519,bKv2iaWN5pQ
165,and I'm hambling happily down the Jaipur,440.569,4.891,bKv2iaWN5pQ
166,Delhi Highway where the xl6 feels quite,442.699,5.94,bKv2iaWN5pQ
167,at home there's really no difference,445.46,5.549,bKv2iaWN5pQ
168,between the xl6 and the Antigua when it,448.639,4.53,bKv2iaWN5pQ
169,comes to driving dynamics the engines,451.009,4.53,bKv2iaWN5pQ
170,are the same suspension is the same so,453.169,5.191,bKv2iaWN5pQ
171,it's got that same kind of mature ride,455.539,5.28,bKv2iaWN5pQ
172,and handling obviously not a very sporty,458.36,4.259,bKv2iaWN5pQ
173,vehicle and Peavy's aren't supposed to,460.819,3.09,bKv2iaWN5pQ
174,be but there's a nice heft to the,462.619,3.931,bKv2iaWN5pQ
175,steering which we really liked in the,463.909,4.171,bKv2iaWN5pQ
176,air tiga and we're reacquainted with,466.55,4.109,bKv2iaWN5pQ
177,that over here the ride also quite,468.08,5.75,bKv2iaWN5pQ
178,mature only the the big potholes can,470.659,5.73,bKv2iaWN5pQ
179,upset it a bit but otherwise a very,473.83,5.859,bKv2iaWN5pQ
180,plant a very mature ride in the sense,476.389,5.731,bKv2iaWN5pQ
181,that it feels very stable very secure,479.689,5.7,bKv2iaWN5pQ
182,and great for cruising and speaking,482.12,5.729,bKv2iaWN5pQ
183,about cruising the one thing the xl6,485.389,5.101,bKv2iaWN5pQ
184,gets which the LD car doesn't have is,487.849,5.13,bKv2iaWN5pQ
185,cruise control and I'm not sure how,490.49,4.739,bKv2iaWN5pQ
186,useful that is on our roads where it's,492.979,4.17,bKv2iaWN5pQ
187,hard to keep a steady speed but yeah I,495.229,3.601,bKv2iaWN5pQ
188,mean on the tsofen stretch it's not so,497.149,6.211,bKv2iaWN5pQ
189,bad so here I have just set it it is a,498.83,10.729,bKv2iaWN5pQ
190,smidgen below 80 kph just before that,503.36,9.69,bKv2iaWN5pQ
191,annoying beep comes the speed limiter,509.559,5.111,bKv2iaWN5pQ
192,warning,513.05,3.96,bKv2iaWN5pQ
193,I'm not sure if it saved lives but it's,514.67,9.18,bKv2iaWN5pQ
194,sure as hell kill the fund the other,517.01,9.12,bKv2iaWN5pQ
195,thing the Excel six gets is Maruti,523.85,5.1,bKv2iaWN5pQ
196,Suzuki is smart play studio which is,526.13,6.21,bKv2iaWN5pQ
197,their latest infotainment system it's,528.95,6.33,bKv2iaWN5pQ
198,got some connected features which we'll,532.34,6.09,bKv2iaWN5pQ
199,have a look at in a bit the seven-inch,535.28,5.13,bKv2iaWN5pQ
200,touchscreen is fairly slick and easy to,538.43,4.05,bKv2iaWN5pQ
201,use and you can also add in Suzuki,540.41,4.68,bKv2iaWN5pQ
202,connect as an option that brings Isom,542.48,4.29,bKv2iaWN5pQ
203,based connected tech which is the new,545.09,3.36,bKv2iaWN5pQ
204,trend these days you get all the,546.77,3.36,bKv2iaWN5pQ
205,features like music streaming weather,548.45,4.92,bKv2iaWN5pQ
206,updates and more through the app you can,550.13,4.83,bKv2iaWN5pQ
207,keep a track of your driving style and,553.37,4.14,bKv2iaWN5pQ
208,send maps to your car and even geofence,554.96,4.71,bKv2iaWN5pQ
209,it but the best party trick you find in,557.51,3.75,bKv2iaWN5pQ
210,other connected cars of remotely,559.67,3.36,bKv2iaWN5pQ
211,starting the engine and turning on the,561.26,4.11,bKv2iaWN5pQ
212,aircon isn't available but let's not,563.03,4.56,bKv2iaWN5pQ
213,forget that for the price this is still,565.37,5.72,bKv2iaWN5pQ
214,a very loaded car,567.59,3.5,bKv2iaWN5pQ
215,the Excel six is essentially a spruced,571.58,4.44,bKv2iaWN5pQ
216,up version of the very capable and,574.16,3.99,bKv2iaWN5pQ
217,competent Ortega so that's a great,576.02,4.56,bKv2iaWN5pQ
218,starting point yes it does lose the,578.15,5.25,bKv2iaWN5pQ
219,superb 1.5 diesel engine but the smooth,580.58,5.61,bKv2iaWN5pQ
220,and fast free 1.5 petrol does suit the,583.4,4.95,bKv2iaWN5pQ
221,more premium character the petrol manual,586.19,4.35,bKv2iaWN5pQ
222,alpha trim is a touch pricey and is a,588.35,3.81,bKv2iaWN5pQ
223,bit of a premium to to pay for the,590.54,4.14,bKv2iaWN5pQ
224,automatics but your money does go a long,592.16,5.37,bKv2iaWN5pQ
225,way it's well equipped spacious easy to,594.68,5.46,bKv2iaWN5pQ
226,drive and very practical and if it's six,597.53,4.98,bKv2iaWN5pQ
227,seats you want this is the best car you,600.14,5.24,bKv2iaWN5pQ
228,can get for the money,602.51,2.87,bKv2iaWN5pQ

36,stands for are what help you prevent a,103.439,4.801,PI2AfIKdcZg
37,crash while we have seen adas before it,105.439,5.601,PI2AfIKdcZg
38,is a standout feature for the xuv700,108.24,5.36,PI2AfIKdcZg
39,because this is a segment first,111.04,5.039,PI2AfIKdcZg
40,so the adaptive cruise control works,113.6,4.799,PI2AfIKdcZg
41,really well all you need to do is press,116.079,5.04,PI2AfIKdcZg
42,cruise control set your desired speed,118.399,4.961,PI2AfIKdcZg
43,and then you can set the distance to the,121.119,4.241,PI2AfIKdcZg
44,car in front of you and it's a,123.36,4.079,PI2AfIKdcZg
45,three-step setting that you can have,125.36,4.319,PI2AfIKdcZg
46,either in close,127.439,3.6,PI2AfIKdcZg
47,far,129.679,4.241,PI2AfIKdcZg
48,or really like a safe mode,131.039,6.401,PI2AfIKdcZg
49,i've got it in its closest setting,133.92,4.72,PI2AfIKdcZg
50,and then,137.44,2.799,PI2AfIKdcZg
51,take your feet off the pedals and let,138.64,3.52,PI2AfIKdcZg
52,the car do all the work for you all you,140.239,5.36,PI2AfIKdcZg
53,have to do is just steer the car along,142.16,7.04,PI2AfIKdcZg
54,and it will do the rest of the work,145.599,3.601,PI2AfIKdcZg
55,now on the cornering you can see that,149.36,3.84,PI2AfIKdcZg
56,the system,151.84,3.119,PI2AfIKdcZg
57,takes it a little slower it doesn't,153.2,4.16,PI2AfIKdcZg
58,actually keep quite up with the car in,154.959,4.64,PI2AfIKdcZg
59,front it takes the corner at a speed,157.36,4.08,PI2AfIKdcZg
60,that's safe for the car,159.599,3.841,PI2AfIKdcZg
61,now if the car in front of you slows,161.44,6.96,PI2AfIKdcZg
62,down suddenly and then starts off again,163.44,7.04,PI2AfIKdcZg
63,the system works just fine to slow you,168.4,5.919,PI2AfIKdcZg
64,down and start you off again,170.48,6.64,PI2AfIKdcZg
65,if the car in front decides to come to a,174.319,5.84,PI2AfIKdcZg
66,complete halt,177.12,3.039,PI2AfIKdcZg
67,this will do,180.56,4.48,PI2AfIKdcZg
68,the same and then start off again as,182.0,7.44,PI2AfIKdcZg
69,well so yeah um it works really well,185.04,6.8,PI2AfIKdcZg
70,my feet are firmly planted on the floor,189.44,3.68,PI2AfIKdcZg
71,haven't touched the brakes haven't,191.84,3.52,PI2AfIKdcZg
72,touched the accelerator,193.12,4.479,PI2AfIKdcZg
73,i'm just driving along comfortably,195.36,5.44,PI2AfIKdcZg
74,keeping pace with the car in front,197.599,6.401,PI2AfIKdcZg
75,and should a biker or a pedestrian cross,200.8,5.76,PI2AfIKdcZg
76,your path unexpectedly the emergency,204.0,4.48,PI2AfIKdcZg
77,brakes will kick in,206.56,4.319,PI2AfIKdcZg
78,and when your lane keep assist is on you,208.48,4.24,PI2AfIKdcZg
79,can even really take your hands off the,210.879,3.841,PI2AfIKdcZg
80,steering wheel for a bit,212.72,4.56,PI2AfIKdcZg
81,because the car will keep to the lane,214.72,4.799,PI2AfIKdcZg
82,for you once there are clear lane,217.28,4.0,PI2AfIKdcZg
83,markings around,219.519,3.36,PI2AfIKdcZg
84,if you're veering off your lane the lane,221.28,3.679,PI2AfIKdcZg
85,departure warning will gently tug at,222.879,3.92,PI2AfIKdcZg
86,your steering wheel to warn you as well,224.959,4.081,PI2AfIKdcZg
87,as give you an alarm the intensity of,226.799,4.8,PI2AfIKdcZg
88,the warnings can be preset as well,229.04,4.16,PI2AfIKdcZg
89,the reaction time of the system may,231.599,3.041,PI2AfIKdcZg
90,differ from yours and so it takes a,233.2,3.2,PI2AfIKdcZg
91,little getting used to but once you do,234.64,4.64,PI2AfIKdcZg
92,you will find it all works really well,236.4,4.32,PI2AfIKdcZg
93,in fact so well that you might be,239.28,3.039,PI2AfIKdcZg
94,tempted to take your hands off the wheel,240.72,3.36,PI2AfIKdcZg
95,completely and take a nap but remember,242.319,3.28,PI2AfIKdcZg
96,to always keep your hands on the wheel,244.08,3.2,PI2AfIKdcZg
97,and eyes on the road there's nothing,245.599,3.28,PI2AfIKdcZg
98,like human instinct,247.28,3.36,PI2AfIKdcZg
99,there are additional safety features,248.879,3.841,PI2AfIKdcZg
100,like the personalized safety alert that,250.64,4.319,PI2AfIKdcZg
101,records the voice of a loved one warning,252.72,4.4,PI2AfIKdcZg
102,you when you're over speeding,254.959,4.0,PI2AfIKdcZg
103,there's a lane watch camera that kicks,257.12,3.6,PI2AfIKdcZg
104,in when you use the indicators and shows,258.959,3.361,PI2AfIKdcZg
105,you something that's too close behind,260.72,3.36,PI2AfIKdcZg
106,you or in a blind spot,262.32,3.84,PI2AfIKdcZg
107,there's also a 360 degree camera that,264.08,3.839,PI2AfIKdcZg
108,can be accessed on the go and has,266.16,3.759,PI2AfIKdcZg
109,multiple view settings to see every,267.919,4.321,PI2AfIKdcZg
110,possible angle around the car,269.919,4.321,PI2AfIKdcZg
111,so yeah mahindra said safety is a core,272.24,4.72,PI2AfIKdcZg
112,pillar of the xuv700 and it sure looks,274.24,4.959,PI2AfIKdcZg
113,like it let's take a look at all the,276.96,5.56,PI2AfIKdcZg
114,safety features,279.199,3.321,PI2AfIKdcZg
115,well i'm sure you want to know all about,284.96,5.16,PI2AfIKdcZg
116,the other exciting features that the,287.919,4.961,PI2AfIKdcZg
117,xuv700 comes with and i will be telling,290.12,5.24,PI2AfIKdcZg
118,you in detail later on the story so stay,292.88,4.0,PI2AfIKdcZg
119,tuned to the whole story right to the,295.36,3.839,PI2AfIKdcZg
120,end to know all about them but for now,296.88,5.039,PI2AfIKdcZg
121,let's talk about the engines,299.199,5.44,PI2AfIKdcZg
122,the xuv700 is powered by a 2.2 liter,301.919,4.881,PI2AfIKdcZg
123,turbo diesel with two power iterations a,304.639,6.4,PI2AfIKdcZg
124,155 hp with 360 nm of torque or a class,306.8,8.0,PI2AfIKdcZg
125,leading 185 hp with 420 nm of torque on,311.039,6.481,PI2AfIKdcZg
126,the manual and 450 nm of torque on the,314.8,4.88,PI2AfIKdcZg
127,auto there is also the most powerful,317.52,4.239,PI2AfIKdcZg
128,iteration of mahindra's m stallion 2,319.68,4.32,PI2AfIKdcZg
129,liter turbo petrol that produces a very,321.759,5.921,PI2AfIKdcZg
130,strong 200 hp and 380 nm of torque,324.0,5.44,PI2AfIKdcZg
131,making it the most powerful in its,327.68,3.04,PI2AfIKdcZg
132,segment,329.44,3.12,PI2AfIKdcZg
133,they both come with a six-speed manual,330.72,3.199,PI2AfIKdcZg
134,and a six-speed torque converter,332.56,3.44,PI2AfIKdcZg
135,automatic and as i've said before for,333.919,3.601,PI2AfIKdcZg
136,those who believe that an suv is,336.0,3.759,PI2AfIKdcZg
137,incomplete without off-road hardware you,337.52,6.08,PI2AfIKdcZg
138,will get the option of all-wheel drive,339.759,5.521,PI2AfIKdcZg
139,now i've kicked it off with the petrol,343.6,2.96,PI2AfIKdcZg
140,automatic,345.28,2.8,PI2AfIKdcZg
141,which is going to be a popular choice,346.56,3.919,PI2AfIKdcZg
142,because this is a creamy smooth engine,348.08,5.52,PI2AfIKdcZg
143,that really brings a smile to your face,350.479,5.121,PI2AfIKdcZg
144,now it's not a punchy shove of torque,353.6,3.599,PI2AfIKdcZg
145,that you get when the turbo kicks in but,355.6,5.2,PI2AfIKdcZg
146,it's more of a very solid strong linear,357.199,6.081,PI2AfIKdcZg
147,acceleration and it's quick so it's,360.8,4.0,PI2AfIKdcZg
148,really delightful,363.28,3.44,PI2AfIKdcZg
149,a preliminary test at the track gave us,364.8,4.8,PI2AfIKdcZg
150,a 0-100 time of 9.32 seconds and that,366.72,5.44,PI2AfIKdcZg
151,makes it the fastest in its class,369.6,4.96,PI2AfIKdcZg
152,this is a cracker of an engine power,372.16,5.52,PI2AfIKdcZg
153,kicks in around 1800 rpm after which you,374.56,6.639,PI2AfIKdcZg
154,ride a big giant wave,377.68,6.4,PI2AfIKdcZg
155,now today it's a test track and the,381.199,5.44,PI2AfIKdcZg
156,delightful part is i have no speed limit,384.08,8.8,PI2AfIKdcZg
157,so yeah uh 142 45 47 48 49 50 51 it just,386.639,8.4,PI2AfIKdcZg
158,keeps going and the way this gets to,392.88,5.2,PI2AfIKdcZg
159,alarming numbers of triple digit speeds,395.039,6.16,PI2AfIKdcZg
160,is just fantastic,398.08,6.0,PI2AfIKdcZg
161,it does it so easily this engine really,401.199,4.72,PI2AfIKdcZg
162,breathes easy,404.08,4.48,PI2AfIKdcZg
163,and while flying around this high speed,405.919,4.801,PI2AfIKdcZg
164,track over here i mean i'm doing around,408.56,5.12,PI2AfIKdcZg
165,160 i'm on the banking,410.72,6.479,PI2AfIKdcZg
166,and i can keep going,413.68,3.519,PI2AfIKdcZg
167,grip is amazing body control is amazing,417.28,5.359,PI2AfIKdcZg
168,roll is well contained,420.16,5.039,PI2AfIKdcZg
169,and even the steering wheel is giving me,422.639,6.4,PI2AfIKdcZg
170,an amazing amount of confidence,425.199,7.201,PI2AfIKdcZg
171,so really the dynamics are good enough,429.039,4.961,PI2AfIKdcZg
172,to keep up with the power that this,432.4,3.919,PI2AfIKdcZg
173,engine has,434.0,5.12,PI2AfIKdcZg
174,but coming back to the performance,436.319,4.561,PI2AfIKdcZg
175,there's a joy in knowing that whenever,439.12,4.56,PI2AfIKdcZg
176,you want power it will be served up even,440.88,5.84,PI2AfIKdcZg
177,at higher speeds put your foot down,443.68,5.519,PI2AfIKdcZg
178,and it's always ready to give you some,446.72,4.16,PI2AfIKdcZg
179,more,449.199,3.681,PI2AfIKdcZg
180,so overtakes on the highway will come,450.88,4.319,PI2AfIKdcZg
181,very easy,452.88,3.759,PI2AfIKdcZg
182,now as,455.199,3.12,PI2AfIKdcZg
183,good as this feels out on the highway,456.639,3.68,PI2AfIKdcZg
184,it's as tractable in city driving,458.319,3.521,PI2AfIKdcZg
185,conditions which we're simulating with a,460.319,3.681,PI2AfIKdcZg
186,car driving in front of me now it's,461.84,5.199,PI2AfIKdcZg
187,crawling along at low speeds stopping,464.0,4.4,PI2AfIKdcZg
188,starting,467.039,3.84,PI2AfIKdcZg
189,and simulating basically what driving in,468.4,4.96,PI2AfIKdcZg
190,traffic would be like and i have to say,470.879,5.201,PI2AfIKdcZg
191,it is really a breeze this makes very,473.36,5.44,PI2AfIKdcZg
192,light work of driving in congested,476.08,4.32,PI2AfIKdcZg
193,conditions,478.8,3.28,PI2AfIKdcZg
194,the steering is light and easy so,480.4,3.6,PI2AfIKdcZg
195,nipping in and out of traffic gaps is,482.08,3.839,PI2AfIKdcZg
196,going to be simple taking u-turns will,484.0,4.08,PI2AfIKdcZg
197,be pretty easy as well and so will,485.919,3.601,PI2AfIKdcZg
198,parking be,488.08,3.679,PI2AfIKdcZg
199,and when you want to park you do have,489.52,4.799,PI2AfIKdcZg
200,that 360 degree camera as well to help,491.759,5.681,PI2AfIKdcZg
201,you with visibility all around,494.319,4.72,PI2AfIKdcZg
202,a lot of the ease of the driving comes,497.44,3.36,PI2AfIKdcZg
203,from the ice and source six-speak torque,499.039,3.921,PI2AfIKdcZg
204,converter automatic that seems to always,500.8,4.799,PI2AfIKdcZg
205,be in sync with your driving needs,502.96,4.16,PI2AfIKdcZg
206,and when you want a sudden burst of,505.599,3.361,PI2AfIKdcZg
207,power for an overtake the downshifts,507.12,3.84,PI2AfIKdcZg
208,come quick enough,508.96,3.759,PI2AfIKdcZg
209,and even the up shifts are so,510.96,4.16,PI2AfIKdcZg
210,progressive and smooth,512.719,4.161,PI2AfIKdcZg
211,while driving on the winding section of,515.12,3.68,PI2AfIKdcZg
212,road i didn't feel the need to use the,516.88,4.32,PI2AfIKdcZg
213,manual mode the engine and gearbox work,518.8,4.719,PI2AfIKdcZg
214,so well in tandem to ensure that it's a,521.2,3.52,PI2AfIKdcZg
215,fun drive,523.519,3.921,PI2AfIKdcZg
216,there are no paddles on the xuv but,524.72,5.6,PI2AfIKdcZg
217,honestly so far i haven't missed them,527.44,6.32,PI2AfIKdcZg
218,on a winding section of road,530.32,5.519,PI2AfIKdcZg
219,body control is good,533.76,3.92,PI2AfIKdcZg
220,roll is well contained,535.839,5.761,PI2AfIKdcZg
221,and the steering weighs up quite nicely,537.68,5.92,PI2AfIKdcZg
222,overall dynamic capability has taken a,541.6,3.76,PI2AfIKdcZg
223,huge leap forward and a lot of it has to,543.6,3.44,PI2AfIKdcZg
224,do with the torsional stiffness of the,545.36,4.159,PI2AfIKdcZg
225,new chassis which is 80 better than,547.04,5.04,PI2AfIKdcZg
226,before giving the car a great base to,549.519,7.961,PI2AfIKdcZg
227,build on it feels like it's built tough,552.08,5.4,PI2AfIKdcZg
228,now from one auto to the other i'm,562.48,2.96,PI2AfIKdcZg
229,driving the diesel auto now which is,563.92,4.08,PI2AfIKdcZg
230,going to be another favorite,565.44,4.399,PI2AfIKdcZg
231,i have to say the engine here too is,568.0,3.76,PI2AfIKdcZg
232,pretty refined and smooth and it's only,569.839,4.321,PI2AfIKdcZg
233,when you push it hard then you realize,571.76,5.6,PI2AfIKdcZg
234,it's a diesel the order box works well,574.16,5.2,PI2AfIKdcZg
235,here too but it doesn't really mask the,577.36,2.96,PI2AfIKdcZg
236,lag,579.36,3.28,PI2AfIKdcZg
237,so you know at particularly low speeds,580.32,4.32,PI2AfIKdcZg
238,when you slow down and,582.64,3.28,PI2AfIKdcZg
239,you know like you would be doing in a,584.64,2.72,PI2AfIKdcZg
240,city and you want a sudden burst of,585.92,3.28,PI2AfIKdcZg
241,power to start up again you might have,587.36,3.84,PI2AfIKdcZg
242,to wait that little moment,589.2,4.72,PI2AfIKdcZg
243,but having said that this engine and,591.2,4.319,PI2AfIKdcZg
244,gearbox combination is probably one of,593.92,3.28,PI2AfIKdcZg
245,the best in the segment i'd go as far as,595.519,5.521,PI2AfIKdcZg
246,saying that it does feel quick,597.2,5.28,PI2AfIKdcZg
247,the engine is another really good,601.04,3.44,PI2AfIKdcZg
248,offering from eminem and belts out power,602.48,4.32,PI2AfIKdcZg
249,strongly and our test on the mahindra,604.48,5.12,PI2AfIKdcZg
250,track we hit the 100 mark in 10.34,606.8,5.52,PI2AfIKdcZg
251,seconds making it another really quick,609.6,5.04,PI2AfIKdcZg
252,powertrain,612.32,3.84,PI2AfIKdcZg
253,now the key difference between the,614.64,3.52,PI2AfIKdcZg
254,diesel and the petrol is that in the,616.16,4.72,PI2AfIKdcZg
255,diesel you get drive modes and the drive,618.16,5.52,PI2AfIKdcZg
256,modes are called zip zap and zoom zip is,620.88,5.199,PI2AfIKdcZg
257,obviously for economy and that uses only,623.68,3.92,PI2AfIKdcZg
258,155,626.079,2.481,PI2AfIKdcZg
259,hp,627.6,3.6,PI2AfIKdcZg
260,when you shift to zap you unleash the,628.56,3.399,PI2AfIKdcZg
261,full,631.2,3.92,PI2AfIKdcZg
262,185 hp and you can feel the difference,631.959,6.921,PI2AfIKdcZg
263,almost instantly and zoom,635.12,4.8,PI2AfIKdcZg
264,well,638.88,3.6,PI2AfIKdcZg
265,that really brings a smile to your face,639.92,5.359,PI2AfIKdcZg
266,the throttle responses get much quicker,642.48,6.88,PI2AfIKdcZg
267,and it feels fun to drive you also have,645.279,6.8,PI2AfIKdcZg
268,a custom mode,649.36,4.08,PI2AfIKdcZg
269,with the choice of modes whether you're,652.079,3.601,PI2AfIKdcZg
270,crawling in city traffic or on a highway,653.44,7.079,PI2AfIKdcZg
271,power is served up when you need it,655.68,4.839,PI2AfIKdcZg
272,it does feel a little nose heavy,660.64,4.72,PI2AfIKdcZg
273,compared to the petrol and so it's not,662.88,4.72,PI2AfIKdcZg
274,quite as agile,665.36,5.36,PI2AfIKdcZg
275,but it still feels solid secure planted,667.6,6.56,PI2AfIKdcZg
276,cornering feels very good as well,670.72,5.76,PI2AfIKdcZg
277,and you get a very nice connected feel,674.16,3.679,PI2AfIKdcZg
278,to the road,676.48,3.599,PI2AfIKdcZg
279,but the steering is heavier than it is,677.839,4.0,PI2AfIKdcZg
280,in the petrol,680.079,3.041,PI2AfIKdcZg
281,while it does feel a little more,681.839,2.961,PI2AfIKdcZg
282,weighted than the petrol it is still,683.12,3.6,PI2AfIKdcZg
283,light enough for city maneuvers and,684.8,4.56,PI2AfIKdcZg
284,parking the two manual variants are,686.72,4.64,PI2AfIKdcZg
285,being driven by surges out in the real,689.36,5.28,PI2AfIKdcZg
286,world so it's over to him now,691.36,4.719,PI2AfIKdcZg
287,so while renuka has been driving the,694.64,3.36,PI2AfIKdcZg
288,automatics on the track i'm here with,696.079,3.921,PI2AfIKdcZg
289,the manuals out on the highway out in,698.0,3.68,PI2AfIKdcZg
290,the real world and it's given us a small,700.0,3.44,PI2AfIKdcZg
291,little chance to feel what they feel,701.68,4.48,PI2AfIKdcZg
292,like out on our regular roads,703.44,4.72,PI2AfIKdcZg
293,i've wit of course the diesel manual and,706.16,3.76,PI2AfIKdcZg
294,this would be my pick between the two,708.16,4.56,PI2AfIKdcZg
295,diesels the gearbox does let you use the,709.92,5.52,PI2AfIKdcZg
296,power much more effectively and in the,712.72,4.4,PI2AfIKdcZg
297,auto that little bit of lag that you,715.44,2.48,PI2AfIKdcZg
298,feel,717.12,2.8,PI2AfIKdcZg
299,you can just drive around it with manual,717.92,4.4,PI2AfIKdcZg
300,control,719.92,4.4,PI2AfIKdcZg
301,the gear shifts are not the smoothest,722.32,5.92,PI2AfIKdcZg
302,but it's not a big complaint either,724.32,3.92,PI2AfIKdcZg
303,what's amazing is of course that,728.56,4.0,PI2AfIKdcZg
304,refinement from the engine,730.399,4.161,PI2AfIKdcZg
305,another bit i was keen to experience out,732.56,3.76,PI2AfIKdcZg
306,here was the ride,734.56,3.519,PI2AfIKdcZg
307,and it's a massive improvement over the,736.32,3.519,PI2AfIKdcZg
308,xuv500,738.079,3.76,PI2AfIKdcZg
309,it isn't class leading and doesn't quite,739.839,4.24,PI2AfIKdcZg
310,flatten the surface but the ride is well,741.839,4.081,PI2AfIKdcZg
311,composed and you don't get tossed around,744.079,3.681,PI2AfIKdcZg
312,on bad roads,745.92,3.919,PI2AfIKdcZg
313,highway ride 2 is well composed and you,747.76,4.48,PI2AfIKdcZg
314,can confidently carry high digit speeds,749.839,5.281,PI2AfIKdcZg
315,over even less than perfect surfaces,752.24,4.48,PI2AfIKdcZg
316,and now it's over to the one for the,755.12,5.12,PI2AfIKdcZg
317,petrol heads the petrol manual,756.72,6.239,PI2AfIKdcZg
318,so we are with the petrol manual now,760.24,4.719,PI2AfIKdcZg
319,this powertrain combination forms the,762.959,5.201,PI2AfIKdcZg
320,entry point to the xuv700 series having,764.959,4.961,PI2AfIKdcZg
321,driven it though i can tell you that the,768.16,4.72,PI2AfIKdcZg
322,performance is anything but entry level,769.92,5.84,PI2AfIKdcZg
323,it's an absolute firecracker of a unit,772.88,5.519,PI2AfIKdcZg
324,the 200 horsepower delivers tons of,775.76,4.96,PI2AfIKdcZg
325,performance and the best bit with the,778.399,4.401,PI2AfIKdcZg
326,manual gearbox yes of course you do miss,780.72,3.919,PI2AfIKdcZg
327,the convenience of an auto,782.8,6.96,PI2AfIKdcZg
328,but you can now rev it to its 5800 rpm,784.639,8.241,PI2AfIKdcZg
329,limit and that is really something that,789.76,5.28,PI2AfIKdcZg
330,i'm sure a lot of driving enthusiasts,792.88,5.399,PI2AfIKdcZg
331,would enjoy,795.04,3.239,PI2AfIKdcZg
332,now with the driving done it's time for,800.399,4.961,PI2AfIKdcZg
333,me to hop into the back seat,802.24,4.96,PI2AfIKdcZg
334,backseat space was one of the strengths,805.36,4.4,PI2AfIKdcZg
335,of the xuv500 earlier when it was,807.2,5.199,PI2AfIKdcZg
336,launched but it's been a long time since,809.76,4.96,PI2AfIKdcZg
337,and there now larger cars the safari the,812.399,5.041,PI2AfIKdcZg
338,hector they all have a lot of back seat,814.72,4.32,PI2AfIKdcZg
339,space however,817.44,3.44,PI2AfIKdcZg
340,this one is bigger too there's more,819.04,4.239,PI2AfIKdcZg
341,space between the wheels and it may not,820.88,4.959,PI2AfIKdcZg
342,be class leading but it still is a very,823.279,4.8,PI2AfIKdcZg
343,spacious back seat to tall people will,825.839,4.481,PI2AfIKdcZg
344,be extremely comfortable one behind the,828.079,4.401,PI2AfIKdcZg
345,other and if you're on the passenger,830.32,4.72,PI2AfIKdcZg
346,side you even have this lever to,832.48,4.719,PI2AfIKdcZg
347,move the seat all the way in front get,835.04,4.479,PI2AfIKdcZg
348,really comfy stretch your legs,837.199,6.561,PI2AfIKdcZg
349,and even recline the seat so yeah,839.519,6.241,PI2AfIKdcZg
350,there is ample space and you can get,843.76,3.68,PI2AfIKdcZg
351,very comfortable then you have that,845.76,3.92,PI2AfIKdcZg
352,panoramic sunroof that really makes it,847.44,5.199,PI2AfIKdcZg
353,feel very airy,849.68,4.88,PI2AfIKdcZg
354,you sit high up and visibility to the,852.639,5.2,PI2AfIKdcZg
355,front is good too,854.56,3.279,PI2AfIKdcZg
356,[Music],858.05,3.789,PI2AfIKdcZg
357,as for the ride quality you heard sergis,860.0,3.88,PI2AfIKdcZg
358,is verdict out in the real world and the,861.839,4.721,PI2AfIKdcZg
359,xuv700 uses frequency selective dampers,863.88,4.44,PI2AfIKdcZg
360,and stabilizer bars front and rear to,866.56,3.68,PI2AfIKdcZg
361,give it the composure although the,868.32,3.759,PI2AfIKdcZg
362,engineers at m m have done a great job,870.24,3.36,PI2AfIKdcZg
363,of the ride and handling capability of,872.079,4.721,PI2AfIKdcZg
364,the xuv700 which is a huge leap forward,873.6,6.0,PI2AfIKdcZg
365,from the xuv500 it doesn't quite have,876.8,5.279,PI2AfIKdcZg
366,the finesse of some of its rivals,879.6,4.32,PI2AfIKdcZg
367,now as far as features go for the rear,882.079,4.56,PI2AfIKdcZg
368,seat passengers they get air-con vents a,883.92,4.96,PI2AfIKdcZg
369,usb-c port and an arm rest with,886.639,4.88,PI2AfIKdcZg
370,cupholders,888.88,4.8,PI2AfIKdcZg
371,now with the arm rest up three abreast,891.519,4.241,PI2AfIKdcZg
372,will be comfortable here but why believe,893.68,2.88,PI2AfIKdcZg
373,me,895.76,2.8,PI2AfIKdcZg
374,let me show you,896.56,3.519,PI2AfIKdcZg
375,now while the boys are going to check,898.56,3.279,PI2AfIKdcZg
376,out the middle row i'm going to check,900.079,6.161,PI2AfIKdcZg
377,out the third row back to the petrol,901.839,4.401,PI2AfIKdcZg
378,[Music],907.1,3.61,PI2AfIKdcZg
379,the width remains the same as the,910.72,3.44,PI2AfIKdcZg
380,previous xuv500 and it seats three,912.0,4.639,PI2AfIKdcZg
381,adults quite easily the central console,914.16,4.08,PI2AfIKdcZg
382,does intrude into the rear a bit but,916.639,3.121,PI2AfIKdcZg
383,there is still enough legroom for the,918.24,3.44,PI2AfIKdcZg
384,third passenger,919.76,4.639,PI2AfIKdcZg
385,now getting into the third row is from,921.68,4.56,PI2AfIKdcZg
386,the passenger side because it has that,924.399,4.401,PI2AfIKdcZg
387,single flip and full seat that makes it,926.24,5.039,PI2AfIKdcZg
388,easy,928.8,2.479,PI2AfIKdcZg
389,and it's not so,932.56,4.56,PI2AfIKdcZg
390,difficult for someone my size,934.639,4.56,PI2AfIKdcZg
391,ingress is pretty easy,937.12,4.959,PI2AfIKdcZg
392,there is no recline for the backrest,939.199,4.961,PI2AfIKdcZg
393,so yeah you do sit a bit upright you do,942.079,4.721,PI2AfIKdcZg
394,sit a bit knees up and this is best for,944.16,5.359,PI2AfIKdcZg
395,small kids however you do have an ac,946.8,4.64,PI2AfIKdcZg
396,vent for yourself you have a 12 volt,949.519,3.521,PI2AfIKdcZg
397,charging port,951.44,4.399,PI2AfIKdcZg
398,and you do have cup holders as well back,953.04,4.4,PI2AfIKdcZg
399,here,955.839,3.601,PI2AfIKdcZg
400,we also found later that the rear seat,957.44,4.079,PI2AfIKdcZg
401,does recline but the lever is the one at,959.44,3.759,PI2AfIKdcZg
402,the back of the seat used to flip it,961.519,2.481,PI2AfIKdcZg
403,down,963.199,2.88,PI2AfIKdcZg
404,so it's hard to find and difficult to,964.0,4.32,PI2AfIKdcZg
405,access,966.079,5.041,PI2AfIKdcZg
406,so that's about the third row,968.32,5.04,PI2AfIKdcZg
407,what i have to do tell you as well is,971.12,5.2,PI2AfIKdcZg
408,that the middle row,973.36,2.96,PI2AfIKdcZg
409,is pretty easy even,976.639,4.0,PI2AfIKdcZg
410,elderly people won't find it too high to,978.639,4.64,PI2AfIKdcZg
411,get into because it is pretty much at,980.639,5.041,PI2AfIKdcZg
412,hip level it's not much of a step up,983.279,4.641,PI2AfIKdcZg
413,and the door opens quite wide as well so,985.68,5.44,PI2AfIKdcZg
414,getting in and out is pretty easy now,987.92,5.599,PI2AfIKdcZg
415,while i go and check out the front you,991.12,5.2,PI2AfIKdcZg
416,guys go and check out the boot,993.519,5.12,PI2AfIKdcZg
417,with three rows up boot volume is still,996.32,4.56,PI2AfIKdcZg
418,marginal but it does seem a little more,998.639,4.241,PI2AfIKdcZg
419,than before and of course you can flip,1000.88,4.16,PI2AfIKdcZg
420,and fold the seats down to open up way,1002.88,3.28,PI2AfIKdcZg
421,more room,1005.04,3.359,PI2AfIKdcZg
422,[Music],1006.16,4.72,PI2AfIKdcZg
423,well it is a fresh looking spanking new,1008.399,5.201,PI2AfIKdcZg
424,interior here on the xuv700 and taking,1010.88,4.879,PI2AfIKdcZg
425,center stage of course is this single,1013.6,4.0,PI2AfIKdcZg
426,piece glass screen which houses the,1015.759,3.681,PI2AfIKdcZg
427,infotainment and the digital dial,1017.6,4.72,PI2AfIKdcZg
428,cluster both of them are 10.25 inch,1019.44,5.04,PI2AfIKdcZg
429,sharp graphics and a host of functions,1022.32,4.4,PI2AfIKdcZg
430,and we'll get to those in a bit but for,1024.48,4.719,PI2AfIKdcZg
431,now let me show you around the interior,1026.72,4.479,PI2AfIKdcZg
432,the dash is very neatly laid out there's,1029.199,3.681,PI2AfIKdcZg
433,a leather finish across the middle you,1031.199,4.401,PI2AfIKdcZg
434,get a chrome look plastic plastics are,1032.88,4.799,PI2AfIKdcZg
435,nice and they look good as well so yeah,1035.6,4.8,PI2AfIKdcZg
436,finishing and quality of materials looks,1037.679,5.441,PI2AfIKdcZg
437,good there is piano black in the center,1040.4,4.72,PI2AfIKdcZg
438,there are toggle switches over here for,1043.12,5.12,PI2AfIKdcZg
439,easy access to functions uh your hvac,1045.12,5.6,PI2AfIKdcZg
440,controls sit on dials and knobs over,1048.24,5.36,PI2AfIKdcZg
441,here and i quite like that actually,1050.72,5.36,PI2AfIKdcZg
442,the central console has two cup holders,1053.6,4.72,PI2AfIKdcZg
443,what is really nice over here is that,1056.08,4.08,PI2AfIKdcZg
444,you have a wireless charging pad which,1058.32,4.08,PI2AfIKdcZg
445,is easy access over here,1060.16,4.639,PI2AfIKdcZg
446,but you have another extra slot for a,1062.4,5.279,PI2AfIKdcZg
447,phone as well over there and you get usb,1064.799,4.561,PI2AfIKdcZg
448,ports as well,1067.679,4.161,PI2AfIKdcZg
449,for charging you have a rotary dial,1069.36,4.24,PI2AfIKdcZg
450,which lets you access the functions on,1071.84,4.24,PI2AfIKdcZg
451,your infotainment screen as well storage,1073.6,4.56,PI2AfIKdcZg
452,space over here which is quite nice and,1076.08,4.64,PI2AfIKdcZg
453,deep and a nifty handy little tray in,1078.16,4.24,PI2AfIKdcZg
454,the storage space,1080.72,3.44,PI2AfIKdcZg
455,the door pockets can house one liter,1082.4,3.84,PI2AfIKdcZg
456,bottles as well so yeah,1084.16,4.16,PI2AfIKdcZg
457,it seems to be a really practical,1086.24,4.4,PI2AfIKdcZg
458,interior what's new as well here are the,1088.32,4.0,PI2AfIKdcZg
459,seat functions very similar to the,1090.64,3.76,PI2AfIKdcZg
460,mercedes as well there's memory,1092.32,4.08,PI2AfIKdcZg
461,and powered seat functions for the,1094.4,4.88,PI2AfIKdcZg
462,driver side the lumbar support however,1096.4,5.6,PI2AfIKdcZg
463,is manual via a dial on the side of the,1099.28,4.88,PI2AfIKdcZg
464,seat,1102.0,4.0,PI2AfIKdcZg
465,on the ergonomic front while most of it,1104.16,3.92,PI2AfIKdcZg
466,is okay the door unlock button is quite,1106.0,4.32,PI2AfIKdcZg
467,a ways back on the door handle making it,1108.08,4.959,PI2AfIKdcZg
468,a little awkward to access,1110.32,4.479,PI2AfIKdcZg
469,some of the things on the interior that,1113.039,3.52,PI2AfIKdcZg
470,let it down a bit are the piano black,1114.799,3.521,PI2AfIKdcZg
471,finish which is not quite as good as the,1116.559,4.161,PI2AfIKdcZg
472,rivals and the wood look on the doors,1118.32,4.88,PI2AfIKdcZg
473,which stands out as low rent in contrast,1120.72,4.16,PI2AfIKdcZg
474,to the rest,1123.2,3.76,PI2AfIKdcZg
475,the digital cluster has three themes you,1124.88,6.48,PI2AfIKdcZg
476,can choose from and is crisp and clear,1126.96,4.4,PI2AfIKdcZg
477,[Music],1131.59,3.85,PI2AfIKdcZg
478,now while it does let you access a wide,1133.679,3.601,PI2AfIKdcZg
479,variety of driver focus functions and,1135.44,3.84,PI2AfIKdcZg
480,trip information getting in and out of,1137.28,4.48,PI2AfIKdcZg
481,the menus is a bit cumbersome one has to,1139.28,4.399,PI2AfIKdcZg
482,toggle through the menus by a button on,1141.76,4.64,PI2AfIKdcZg
483,the steering wheel and press to access,1143.679,4.88,PI2AfIKdcZg
484,but when you want to revert to the,1146.4,4.399,PI2AfIKdcZg
485,original menu it just isn't a back,1148.559,4.081,PI2AfIKdcZg
486,button that you have to press,1150.799,4.0,PI2AfIKdcZg
487,you have to run through the menu go up,1152.64,4.0,PI2AfIKdcZg
488,to exit and then it doesn't,1154.799,3.841,PI2AfIKdcZg
489,automatically refer to the last info,1156.64,4.0,PI2AfIKdcZg
490,screen you had you would have to,1158.64,4.64,PI2AfIKdcZg
491,re-access it by another set of toggles,1160.64,4.24,PI2AfIKdcZg
492,there is a favorite button to help you,1163.28,3.2,PI2AfIKdcZg
493,get back to a certain menu but that,1164.88,3.52,PI2AfIKdcZg
494,would mean remembering to set a favorite,1166.48,4.319,PI2AfIKdcZg
495,every time you accessed a new menu just,1168.4,3.76,PI2AfIKdcZg
496,so that you could get back to the,1170.799,2.561,PI2AfIKdcZg
497,original one,1172.16,4.879,PI2AfIKdcZg
498,the system could be a whole lot simpler,1173.36,5.679,PI2AfIKdcZg
499,the infotainment screen is also slick,1177.039,4.0,PI2AfIKdcZg
500,and responds well to touch,1179.039,4.081,PI2AfIKdcZg
501,you have a cool 360 degree camera which,1181.039,4.321,PI2AfIKdcZg
502,i spoke to you about earlier and you,1183.12,5.28,PI2AfIKdcZg
503,also have apple carplay and android auto,1185.36,4.72,PI2AfIKdcZg
504,to access functions other than the,1188.4,3.92,PI2AfIKdcZg
505,screen one can either swipe up for all,1190.08,5.92,PI2AfIKdcZg
506,the apps or down for the shortcuts,1192.32,6.239,PI2AfIKdcZg
507,you also get alexa which can access,1196.0,5.52,PI2AfIKdcZg
508,features even without connectivity,1198.559,7.401,PI2AfIKdcZg
509,alexa can you open the sunroof,1201.52,4.44,PI2AfIKdcZg
510,of course when connected you can ask,1208.159,3.201,PI2AfIKdcZg
511,alexa anything from directions to a,1209.6,5.199,PI2AfIKdcZg
512,recipe and she would serve that up too,1211.36,4.799,PI2AfIKdcZg
513,there are also some interesting,1214.799,3.441,PI2AfIKdcZg
514,functions like a geforce meter and a lap,1216.159,5.201,PI2AfIKdcZg
515,time recorder under the fun with xuv tab,1218.24,4.64,PI2AfIKdcZg
516,now the infotainment system was in a,1221.36,3.28,PI2AfIKdcZg
517,beta testing stage so we will reserve,1222.88,4.0,PI2AfIKdcZg
518,comment on its functionality for a later,1224.64,5.2,PI2AfIKdcZg
519,time when we see the final version,1226.88,6.4,PI2AfIKdcZg
520,there is also a 445 watt 12 speaker sony,1229.84,6.24,PI2AfIKdcZg
521,sound system including subwoofers it has,1233.28,5.12,PI2AfIKdcZg
522,3d sound with building blocks technology,1236.08,4.64,PI2AfIKdcZg
523,and digital sound enhancement as well,1238.4,4.32,PI2AfIKdcZg
524,and it gives you a variety of sound,1240.72,5.28,PI2AfIKdcZg
525,settings to suit your hearing needs,1242.72,4.72,PI2AfIKdcZg
526,there are a couple of features that the,1246.0,3.679,PI2AfIKdcZg
527,xuv misses on like ventilated seats and,1247.44,4.08,PI2AfIKdcZg
528,paddle shifts and an auto dimming rear,1249.679,5.441,PI2AfIKdcZg
529,view but the segment first features here,1251.52,5.92,PI2AfIKdcZg
530,outweigh all of that and overall the,1255.12,4.32,PI2AfIKdcZg
531,interior with its extensive equipment,1257.44,5.2,PI2AfIKdcZg
532,list does have a lot of wow factor,1259.44,4.96,PI2AfIKdcZg
533,now while the higher draenox variants,1262.64,4.08,PI2AfIKdcZg
534,get the large twin 10.25 inch screens,1264.4,4.48,PI2AfIKdcZg
535,the lower mx variants will get an eight,1266.72,4.72,PI2AfIKdcZg
536,inch screen and a seven inch cluster,1268.88,4.32,PI2AfIKdcZg
537,now at this time mahindra have given us,1271.44,3.359,PI2AfIKdcZg
538,the feature list on four variants so,1273.2,4.88,PI2AfIKdcZg
539,let's take a look at those,1274.799,3.281,PI2AfIKdcZg
540,[Music],1282.43,5.05,PI2AfIKdcZg
541,finally let's talk about the way the,1285.76,4.88,PI2AfIKdcZg
542,xuv700 looks let's begin with a spanking,1287.48,5.0,PI2AfIKdcZg
543,new logo nestled in the center of the,1290.64,4.08,PI2AfIKdcZg
544,double slatted grille that fans outwards,1292.48,4.64,PI2AfIKdcZg
545,where its lines meet the twin drls the,1294.72,4.24,PI2AfIKdcZg
546,fang like headlamps are a trademark now,1297.12,4.0,PI2AfIKdcZg
547,and extend to the bumper that houses the,1298.96,4.079,PI2AfIKdcZg
548,fogs encased in black cladding and the,1301.12,4.64,PI2AfIKdcZg
549,air dam the bonnet retains the xuv,1303.039,4.401,PI2AfIKdcZg
550,flared sides but they are a little,1305.76,3.12,PI2AfIKdcZg
551,softer now,1307.44,3.84,PI2AfIKdcZg
552,the profile is also very familiar and a,1308.88,4.88,PI2AfIKdcZg
553,lot like the outgoing xuv500,1311.28,4.96,PI2AfIKdcZg
554,but there are the new flush door handles,1313.76,4.24,PI2AfIKdcZg
555,while the top end variants will pop out,1316.24,3.52,PI2AfIKdcZg
556,as you approach the car the mid versions,1318.0,4.08,PI2AfIKdcZg
557,will require to push and then pull open,1319.76,4.32,PI2AfIKdcZg
558,but the base version will require you to,1322.08,4.64,PI2AfIKdcZg
559,use the key unlock push to pop out and,1324.08,4.0,PI2AfIKdcZg
560,pull to open,1326.72,3.04,PI2AfIKdcZg
561,now some people may really like these,1328.08,4.64,PI2AfIKdcZg
562,handles but personally i'm not a fan,1329.76,4.96,PI2AfIKdcZg
563,the top variants get 18-inch alloys,1332.72,3.92,PI2AfIKdcZg
564,while the lower variants get 17-inch,1334.72,4.319,PI2AfIKdcZg
565,steel wheels the rear looks quite nice,1336.64,4.159,PI2AfIKdcZg
566,especially the chisel line that sits,1339.039,3.601,PI2AfIKdcZg
567,between the tail lamps that extend down,1340.799,3.441,PI2AfIKdcZg
568,and over the sides,1342.64,3.76,PI2AfIKdcZg
569,there is a matte silver fake diffuser at,1344.24,5.2,PI2AfIKdcZg
570,the lower end and a spoiler on the top,1346.4,5.36,PI2AfIKdcZg
571,dimension wise the xuv500 has grown,1349.44,4.16,PI2AfIKdcZg
572,overall in length and there is also more,1351.76,4.08,PI2AfIKdcZg
573,space between the wheels but the height,1353.6,4.88,PI2AfIKdcZg
574,is lower and the width remains the same,1355.84,4.48,PI2AfIKdcZg
575,ground clearance seems to be on par with,1358.48,3.92,PI2AfIKdcZg
576,its rivals which should be around 200,1360.32,3.28,PI2AfIKdcZg
577,millimeters,1362.4,3.04,PI2AfIKdcZg
578,this may not turn heads but is,1363.6,6.559,PI2AfIKdcZg
579,definitely a more mature design,1365.44,4.719,PI2AfIKdcZg
580,so why is it called the xuv700 if it's,1370.64,5.6,PI2AfIKdcZg
581,replacing the xuv500 well mostly because,1373.039,5.041,PI2AfIKdcZg
582,it's all new and mahindra didn't want,1376.24,4.16,PI2AfIKdcZg
583,people to think it was just an evolution,1378.08,3.839,PI2AfIKdcZg
584,but also because mahindra are leaving,1380.4,3.36,PI2AfIKdcZg
585,space for a bit size suv to come a,1381.919,6.201,PI2AfIKdcZg
586,little later and take that moniker,1383.76,4.36,PI2AfIKdcZg
587,and mahindra are aiming high they have,1388.32,4.16,PI2AfIKdcZg
588,thrown everything they have at the,1390.88,4.08,PI2AfIKdcZg
589,xuv700 sure it does miss on some,1392.48,4.079,PI2AfIKdcZg
590,features like paddle shifters and,1394.96,3.12,PI2AfIKdcZg
591,ventilated seats which we're used to,1396.559,3.521,PI2AfIKdcZg
592,seeing even in lower segments but then,1398.08,4.32,PI2AfIKdcZg
593,it has kit and equipment that we're used,1400.08,5.04,PI2AfIKdcZg
594,to seeing in segments way above so on,1402.4,4.639,PI2AfIKdcZg
595,the feature and equipment list it,1405.12,4.72,PI2AfIKdcZg
596,definitely has a big tick you've got a,1407.039,6.161,PI2AfIKdcZg
597,multiple choice of diesel petrol manual,1409.84,5.28,PI2AfIKdcZg
598,automatic and even all-wheel drive so,1413.2,3.839,PI2AfIKdcZg
599,yeah there's a wide variety of variants,1415.12,4.64,PI2AfIKdcZg
600,to choose from the jewel in its crown is,1417.039,5.041,PI2AfIKdcZg
601,really the power train these power,1419.76,5.12,PI2AfIKdcZg
602,trains are what bring it alive and,1422.08,4.88,PI2AfIKdcZg
603,mahindra have to be commended on the,1424.88,4.799,PI2AfIKdcZg
604,ride and handling package it has taken,1426.96,5.19,PI2AfIKdcZg
605,many leaps forward,1429.679,4.801,PI2AfIKdcZg
606,[Music],1432.15,4.25,PI2AfIKdcZg
607,then factor in that it is spacious you,1434.48,3.76,PI2AfIKdcZg
608,can get seven seats as well and most,1436.4,4.8,PI2AfIKdcZg
609,importantly the cracking pricing,1438.24,4.72,PI2AfIKdcZg
610,m m have announced prices for four,1441.2,3.52,PI2AfIKdcZg
611,variants as of now with the rest of the,1442.96,3.52,PI2AfIKdcZg
612,optional pack and variance pricing to,1444.72,3.36,PI2AfIKdcZg
613,come later,1446.48,4.319,PI2AfIKdcZg
614,the xuv700 looks set to redefine the,1448.08,5.36,PI2AfIKdcZg
615,segment and it is surely a script to,1450.799,7.321,PI2AfIKdcZg
616,another success story for mahindra,1453.44,4.68,PI2AfIKdcZg
617,but then it has some features and,1459.2,3.599,PI2AfIKdcZg
618,equipment that we're used to seeing in,1460.88,4.399,PI2AfIKdcZg
619,segments,1462.799,2.48,PI2AfIKdcZg
620,but then but then but then,1466.32,3.52,PI2AfIKdcZg
621,that's what distracted me,1470.88,4.64,PI2AfIKdcZg
622,let me take two shots,1472.72,2.8,PI2AfIKdcZg
623,okay come back,1477.039,3.481,PI2AfIKdcZg
0,[Music],1.87,7.09,HE9YtNnvbSs
1,a year ago,8.16,3.359,HE9YtNnvbSs
2,we tested the tata outros and it really,8.96,4.4,HE9YtNnvbSs
3,impressed us with its space,11.519,4.561,HE9YtNnvbSs
4,its ride and handling and of course its,13.36,4.16,HE9YtNnvbSs
5,looks,16.08,3.44,HE9YtNnvbSs
6,but what really didn't impress us too,17.52,4.0,HE9YtNnvbSs
7,much was its petrol engine,19.52,4.48,HE9YtNnvbSs
8,we thought it was underpowered and,21.52,4.079,HE9YtNnvbSs
9,rather unrefined too,24.0,4.84,HE9YtNnvbSs
10,however tata are now making amends with,25.599,4.951,HE9YtNnvbSs
11,this,28.84,5.659,HE9YtNnvbSs
12,[Music],30.55,3.949,HE9YtNnvbSs
13,yes this is the turbocharged version of,34.96,5.439,HE9YtNnvbSs
14,that same motor,37.52,2.879,HE9YtNnvbSs
15,now tata promises that it's transformed,40.879,3.84,HE9YtNnvbSs
16,the driving experience,43.28,2.959,HE9YtNnvbSs
17,and i'm really keen to find out if,44.719,2.421,HE9YtNnvbSs
18,they've succeeded,46.239,3.971,HE9YtNnvbSs
19,[Music],47.14,3.07,HE9YtNnvbSs
20,so i'm going to be focused on the engine,51.28,3.52,HE9YtNnvbSs
21,and its performance,53.44,4.0,HE9YtNnvbSs
22,the rest of the car is pretty similar to,54.8,3.2,HE9YtNnvbSs
23,the regular,57.44,2.799,HE9YtNnvbSs
24,altras but if you do want to have a look,58.0,3.6,HE9YtNnvbSs
25,at that in detail,60.239,3.361,HE9YtNnvbSs
26,then we have the video up on our youtube,61.6,4.08,HE9YtNnvbSs
27,channel and of course don't forget to,63.6,2.879,HE9YtNnvbSs
28,subscribe,65.68,2.4,HE9YtNnvbSs
29,and hit the bell icon and you'll be,66.479,4.481,HE9YtNnvbSs
30,notified every time we post a new video,68.08,4.719,HE9YtNnvbSs
31,now with the turbos trapped on there's,70.96,3.68,HE9YtNnvbSs
32,been a noteworthy bump in power,72.799,5.281,HE9YtNnvbSs
33,from 86 horsepower to 110 torque 2 has,74.64,6.96,HE9YtNnvbSs
34,climbed from 113 newton meters to 140.,78.08,5.12,HE9YtNnvbSs
35,this is still lower than what the engine,81.6,3.199,HE9YtNnvbSs
36,makes in the nexon however,83.2,3.44,HE9YtNnvbSs
37,and that's because the altros's 5-speed,84.799,3.601,HE9YtNnvbSs
38,gearbox would also need to change to,86.64,3.04,HE9YtNnvbSs
39,handle the extra power,88.4,3.24,HE9YtNnvbSs
40,the rated efficiency has dropped from,89.68,3.84,HE9YtNnvbSs
41,19.05 kpl,91.64,5.159,HE9YtNnvbSs
42,to 18.13 not much,93.52,5.599,HE9YtNnvbSs
43,a word of caution though in the real,96.799,5.68,HE9YtNnvbSs
44,world turbo petrols can be thirsty,99.119,4.881,HE9YtNnvbSs
45,now is it an improvement over the,102.479,4.0,HE9YtNnvbSs
46,regular naturally aspirated petrol,104.0,4.479,HE9YtNnvbSs
47,the short answer is yes there is,106.479,3.761,HE9YtNnvbSs
48,certainly more power and the car no,108.479,3.841,HE9YtNnvbSs
49,longer feels like it's dragging anchor,110.24,3.76,HE9YtNnvbSs
50,and it's easy enough to keep up with,112.32,4.079,HE9YtNnvbSs
51,traffic,114.0,4.64,HE9YtNnvbSs
52,demand any more however and it will,116.399,4.481,HE9YtNnvbSs
53,leave you wanting,118.64,3.92,HE9YtNnvbSs
54,the trouble is that while performance is,120.88,4.0,HE9YtNnvbSs
55,an improvement it's nowhere near,122.56,5.28,HE9YtNnvbSs
56,the others like the polo 1.0 tsi that,124.88,3.76,HE9YtNnvbSs
57,has a sub,127.84,2.639,HE9YtNnvbSs
58,10 second time in the zero to 100,128.64,3.2,HE9YtNnvbSs
59,kilometer per hour dash,130.479,3.361,HE9YtNnvbSs
60,the altros claims a time of under 12,131.84,4.119,HE9YtNnvbSs
61,seconds while we only manage,133.84,5.52,HE9YtNnvbSs
62,12.68 in a quick test and this was in,135.959,5.721,HE9YtNnvbSs
63,sport mode,139.36,4.72,HE9YtNnvbSs
64,yes that's right the ultros eye turbo,141.68,4.27,HE9YtNnvbSs
65,has a sport mode,144.08,4.4,HE9YtNnvbSs
66,[Music],145.95,5.649,HE9YtNnvbSs
67,the regular petrol has a eco and a city,148.48,3.759,HE9YtNnvbSs
68,mode,151.599,4.0,HE9YtNnvbSs
69,this one has a city and a sport,152.239,5.521,HE9YtNnvbSs
70,the sport mode isn't peppy though and it,155.599,4.64,HE9YtNnvbSs
71,misses that punchy feel,157.76,4.16,HE9YtNnvbSs
72,the thing is though the power comes in,160.239,3.841,HE9YtNnvbSs
73,at around 1800 rpm,161.92,4.64,HE9YtNnvbSs
74,and rather sedately so you press down,164.08,3.12,HE9YtNnvbSs
75,like this,166.56,4.319,HE9YtNnvbSs
76,and then it'll build up slow all the way,167.2,8.0,HE9YtNnvbSs
77,and then at around about 4800 rpm,170.879,6.801,HE9YtNnvbSs
78,it will catch like a second wind and,175.2,4.56,HE9YtNnvbSs
79,it's certainly fun and entertaining,177.68,3.76,HE9YtNnvbSs
80,but i would have preferred it if it were,179.76,3.839,HE9YtNnvbSs
81,at a lower rev,181.44,4.4,HE9YtNnvbSs
82,the engine is vibration free however,183.599,3.681,HE9YtNnvbSs
83,refinement isn't great,185.84,3.759,HE9YtNnvbSs
84,and it does sound coarse there's also,187.28,4.08,HE9YtNnvbSs
85,some road noise from the front and on,189.599,2.481,HE9YtNnvbSs
86,the whole,191.36,2.72,HE9YtNnvbSs
87,the nvh levels could do with some,192.08,4.48,HE9YtNnvbSs
88,improvement,194.08,2.48,HE9YtNnvbSs
89,the altros's chassis setup of course is,196.959,3.2,HE9YtNnvbSs
90,just fine,199.28,4.56,HE9YtNnvbSs
91,ride is superb as is the handling we've,200.159,5.681,HE9YtNnvbSs
92,really liked it in the car before,203.84,4.8,HE9YtNnvbSs
93,and it remains the same here tata say,205.84,4.24,HE9YtNnvbSs
94,they have made small tweaks to the,208.64,2.8,HE9YtNnvbSs
95,suspension and steering,210.08,3.68,HE9YtNnvbSs
96,and expectedly ride and handling is,211.44,3.28,HE9YtNnvbSs
97,excellent,213.76,2.88,HE9YtNnvbSs
98,the well judged suspension along with,214.72,3.84,HE9YtNnvbSs
99,the stiff and taut body shell,216.64,4.08,HE9YtNnvbSs
100,enable the car to sail over even sharp,218.56,4.8,HE9YtNnvbSs
101,ruts and potholes with ease,220.72,5.2,HE9YtNnvbSs
102,the steering is nice and light at low,223.36,3.68,HE9YtNnvbSs
103,city speeds,225.92,3.52,HE9YtNnvbSs
104,and then at higher speeds into corners,227.04,5.199,HE9YtNnvbSs
105,it weighs up really nicely giving you,229.44,5.519,HE9YtNnvbSs
106,a good amount of confidence and with the,232.239,4.72,HE9YtNnvbSs
107,chassis setup the altros really has the,234.959,2.961,HE9YtNnvbSs
108,potential to be,236.959,3.601,HE9YtNnvbSs
109,a good driver's car,237.92,5.859,HE9YtNnvbSs
110,[Applause],240.56,3.219,HE9YtNnvbSs
111,with the turbo altrus tata has also,244.879,5.121,HE9YtNnvbSs
112,introduced its ira smart connected tech,247.12,5.6,HE9YtNnvbSs
113,a new color the one we have on test and,250.0,4.799,HE9YtNnvbSs
114,there's also new perforated leatherette,252.72,2.96,HE9YtNnvbSs
115,seats,254.799,3.201,HE9YtNnvbSs
116,there's also a new black and light gray,255.68,4.32,HE9YtNnvbSs
117,interior that looks very nice,258.0,3.919,HE9YtNnvbSs
118,and a few extra features like two more,260.0,5.84,HE9YtNnvbSs
119,tweeters on the sweet sounding harman,261.919,3.921,HE9YtNnvbSs
120,system,266.84,3.0,HE9YtNnvbSs
121,so the altro's has a decent amount of,274.639,3.441,HE9YtNnvbSs
122,kit it looks good,276.479,3.841,HE9YtNnvbSs
123,it's got ample space and the ride and,278.08,3.119,HE9YtNnvbSs
124,handling,280.32,3.439,HE9YtNnvbSs
125,is superb there's also the five star,281.199,3.681,HE9YtNnvbSs
126,crash rating to boot,283.759,3.041,HE9YtNnvbSs
127,and tata may also play the value card,284.88,3.36,HE9YtNnvbSs
128,and price it competitively,286.8,3.28,HE9YtNnvbSs
129,the addition of the turbo though hasn't,288.24,3.519,HE9YtNnvbSs
130,transformed the car into the hot hatch,290.08,2.72,HE9YtNnvbSs
131,we expected,291.759,3.281,HE9YtNnvbSs
132,what it has done however is it's brought,292.8,3.2,HE9YtNnvbSs
133,the performance more,295.04,3.12,HE9YtNnvbSs
134,in line with the car sporty character,296.0,4.08,HE9YtNnvbSs
135,and has now nicely rounded off a,298.16,13.039,HE9YtNnvbSs
136,well-packaged car,300.08,13.2,HE9YtNnvbSs

2,now SUVs are really the flavor in India,6.109,4.99,wkYmKJ7nfV8
3,but one can't forget about the NPV,9.09,4.259,wkYmKJ7nfV8
4,segment which is really a great car for,11.099,5.01,wkYmKJ7nfV8
5,the big Indian family there's been a,13.349,4.981,wkYmKJ7nfV8
6,little bit of action in this segment of,16.109,3.871,wkYmKJ7nfV8
7,late with Mahindra launching the Murad,18.33,3.779,wkYmKJ7nfV8
8,so and now after six years Maruti have,19.98,4.92,wkYmKJ7nfV8
9,launched a brand new Ortega they're not,22.109,5.101,wkYmKJ7nfV8
10,deviating too much from the strengths of,24.9,4.23,wkYmKJ7nfV8
11,this car and the essential formula but,27.21,3.36,wkYmKJ7nfV8
12,this time around they've aimed to make,29.13,4.05,wkYmKJ7nfV8
13,it more desirable to the large Indian,30.57,5.22,wkYmKJ7nfV8
14,family as opposed to just fleet and taxi,33.18,4.86,wkYmKJ7nfV8
15,operators let's dive in and find out,35.79,3.03,wkYmKJ7nfV8
16,what's new,38.04,7.19,wkYmKJ7nfV8
17,[Music],38.82,9.45,wkYmKJ7nfV8
18,the urtica has grown in length width and,45.23,5.919,wkYmKJ7nfV8
19,height and visually it does look bigger,48.27,5.49,wkYmKJ7nfV8
20,the front end now gets a sharper nose,51.149,5.25,wkYmKJ7nfV8
21,adorned with a large chrome grille the,53.76,4.83,wkYmKJ7nfV8
22,sleeker wraparound headlights amplify,56.399,4.71,wkYmKJ7nfV8
23,the width and fog lamps encased in black,58.59,4.649,wkYmKJ7nfV8
24,get a dramatic body coloured slash,61.109,5.131,wkYmKJ7nfV8
25,across the contours are all sharper the,63.239,5.161,wkYmKJ7nfV8
26,crease is more pronounced and that lends,66.24,5.25,wkYmKJ7nfV8
27,it a sporty air around the sides the,68.4,5.219,wkYmKJ7nfV8
28,c-pillar now gets styled to give it the,71.49,4.5,wkYmKJ7nfV8
29,look of a floating roof and at the rear,73.619,5.07,wkYmKJ7nfV8
30,a chrome bar extends right across there,75.99,4.53,wkYmKJ7nfV8
31,our snazzy tail lamps that look like,78.689,4.141,wkYmKJ7nfV8
32,they could be from a Volvo overall it,80.52,4.41,wkYmKJ7nfV8
33,looks well proportioned and the styling,82.83,4.35,wkYmKJ7nfV8
34,makes a dramatic difference it is the,84.93,3.99,wkYmKJ7nfV8
35,first step in making it more desirable,87.18,4.02,wkYmKJ7nfV8
36,to families instead of fleet and it,88.92,5.879,wkYmKJ7nfV8
37,definitely works the interior of the,91.2,4.169,wkYmKJ7nfV8
38,Ertiga,94.799,2.761,wkYmKJ7nfV8
39,looks much nicer now in fact when you,95.369,4.471,wkYmKJ7nfV8
40,get inside it feels a lot more premium,97.56,4.769,wkYmKJ7nfV8
41,than it was before you have a nice flat,99.84,4.709,wkYmKJ7nfV8
42,dash which is in in sort of a triple,102.329,4.891,wkYmKJ7nfV8
43,tone with the gray the wood inlay and,104.549,4.471,wkYmKJ7nfV8
44,the beige at the bottom the wood is,107.22,3.24,wkYmKJ7nfV8
45,still a little bit plasticky but,109.02,3.809,wkYmKJ7nfV8
46,honestly at this price point this still,110.46,5.58,wkYmKJ7nfV8
47,looks really good there's a nice for AC,112.829,5.22,wkYmKJ7nfV8
48,vent that runs right across the dash,116.04,4.439,wkYmKJ7nfV8
49,giving it a good amount of width you get,118.049,4.231,wkYmKJ7nfV8
50,the touchscreen infotainment you get,120.479,3.96,wkYmKJ7nfV8
51,climate control you get steering mounted,122.28,5.819,wkYmKJ7nfV8
52,controls you have nice big dials with,124.439,5.371,wkYmKJ7nfV8
53,the info display in the middle that,128.099,3.871,wkYmKJ7nfV8
54,gives you a series of functions as well,129.81,3.35,wkYmKJ7nfV8
55,the,131.97,4.52,wkYmKJ7nfV8
56,front seats are much wider now very,133.16,6.3,wkYmKJ7nfV8
57,comfortable to be in and overall this,136.49,5.9,wkYmKJ7nfV8
58,interior feels much better than before,139.46,4.8,wkYmKJ7nfV8
59,things like the leather wrap steering,142.39,4.63,wkYmKJ7nfV8
60,the cooled cupholders automatic climate,144.26,4.83,wkYmKJ7nfV8
61,control just build on the premium feel,147.02,3.9,wkYmKJ7nfV8
62,of the new interior the,149.09,3.75,wkYmKJ7nfV8
63,multi-information display emits the,150.92,4.38,wkYmKJ7nfV8
64,dials has plenty of information and even,152.84,4.53,wkYmKJ7nfV8
65,has cool displays of power and torque,155.3,3.87,wkYmKJ7nfV8
66,being used along with the regular,157.37,4.2,wkYmKJ7nfV8
67,average fuel consumption date and time,159.17,5.13,wkYmKJ7nfV8
68,the infotainment system has Android auto,161.57,5.58,wkYmKJ7nfV8
69,apple carplay and mirror link it also,164.3,5.07,wkYmKJ7nfV8
70,has inbuilt navigation there are plenty,167.15,4.44,wkYmKJ7nfV8
71,of storage areas in the door pockets for,169.37,4.5,wkYmKJ7nfV8
72,all of the rows and there is a nice flat,171.59,4.59,wkYmKJ7nfV8
73,area in front of the gear lever to store,173.87,5.97,wkYmKJ7nfV8
74,your phone as well let's also take a,176.18,5.52,wkYmKJ7nfV8
75,look at the safety features on the,179.84,3.26,wkYmKJ7nfV8
76,Ortega,181.7,6.71,wkYmKJ7nfV8
77,[Music],183.1,8.68,wkYmKJ7nfV8
78,now the large rear doors of the article,188.41,6.04,wkYmKJ7nfV8
79,means ingress is very easy into the,191.78,4.89,wkYmKJ7nfV8
80,middle row not only that the seat is,194.45,4.44,wkYmKJ7nfV8
81,quite low so actually you can just slide,196.67,3.84,wkYmKJ7nfV8
82,in you don't even need to climb in,198.89,4.44,wkYmKJ7nfV8
83,that's a good point and now this middle,200.51,5.94,wkYmKJ7nfV8
84,row has a single touch tilt and slide,203.33,8.31,wkYmKJ7nfV8
85,functions so getting in to this third,206.45,9.57,wkYmKJ7nfV8
86,row is also much much easier now now I'm,211.64,7.65,wkYmKJ7nfV8
87,five foot four and as you can see even,216.02,5.79,wkYmKJ7nfV8
88,with the middle row all the way back I'm,219.29,5.88,wkYmKJ7nfV8
89,still quite comfortable I fit in quite,221.81,5.88,wkYmKJ7nfV8
90,easily I'm a little knees up but I can,225.17,5.45,wkYmKJ7nfV8
91,stretch my feet under this middle row so,227.69,5.67,wkYmKJ7nfV8
92,you know I can be here for a,230.62,4.09,wkYmKJ7nfV8
93,considerable amount of time on this,233.36,4.02,wkYmKJ7nfV8
94,journey I have the cup holder I have the,234.71,5.64,wkYmKJ7nfV8
95,charger I have quite a large window area,237.38,6.39,wkYmKJ7nfV8
96,so honestly this third row is a big,240.35,6.9,wkYmKJ7nfV8
97,improvement from before the rear seat,243.77,5.64,wkYmKJ7nfV8
98,also has a recline function which means,247.25,3.99,wkYmKJ7nfV8
99,third row passengers can really get,249.41,4.41,wkYmKJ7nfV8
100,comfortable but what does that mean for,251.24,5.19,wkYmKJ7nfV8
101,the boot space now when one's buying a,253.82,4.56,wkYmKJ7nfV8
102,larger car of course boot space is,256.43,4.95,wkYmKJ7nfV8
103,important and in this one even with the,258.38,4.98,wkYmKJ7nfV8
104,third row up you have a reasonable,261.38,3.69,wkYmKJ7nfV8
105,amount of space you can fit three Strohl,263.36,3.87,wkYmKJ7nfV8
106,even here quite comfortably and there's,265.07,4.98,wkYmKJ7nfV8
107,this cool storage area underneath the,267.23,4.56,wkYmKJ7nfV8
108,boot at the back where you can actually,270.05,3.869,wkYmKJ7nfV8
109,keep some parcels keep it hidden so if,271.79,3.39,wkYmKJ7nfV8
110,you parked your car and you want to go,273.919,4.351,wkYmKJ7nfV8
111,somewhere it's a nice storage area it,275.18,5.28,wkYmKJ7nfV8
112,has the split lid so it's convenient to,278.27,4.77,wkYmKJ7nfV8
113,access as well and of course once you,280.46,4.26,wkYmKJ7nfV8
114,flip down the seats you can open up more,283.04,2.29,wkYmKJ7nfV8
115,room,284.72,5.66,wkYmKJ7nfV8
116,[Music],285.33,7.67,wkYmKJ7nfV8
117,all the variants were on offer to drive,290.38,4.45,wkYmKJ7nfV8
118,and I opted for the popular people's,293.0,4.71,wkYmKJ7nfV8
119,choice first the diesel the 1.3 litre,294.83,5.76,wkYmKJ7nfV8
120,Fiat sauced engine that has 90 HP and,297.71,7.019,wkYmKJ7nfV8
121,200 ml for now initial impression from,300.59,6.84,wkYmKJ7nfV8
122,behind the wheel is you know that it,304.729,4.651,wkYmKJ7nfV8
123,seems quite car like actually to drive,307.43,5.489,wkYmKJ7nfV8
124,now because of this flat - and it gives,309.38,5.91,wkYmKJ7nfV8
125,you great visibility but it's got a nice,312.919,4.051,wkYmKJ7nfV8
126,high seating position so it gives you,315.29,6.27,wkYmKJ7nfV8
127,the commanding feel as well now this,316.97,7.949,wkYmKJ7nfV8
128,engine is one that's been around a long,321.56,6.03,wkYmKJ7nfV8
129,while for Maruti it's the tried and,324.919,7.081,wkYmKJ7nfV8
130,tested diesel it's now feeling quite old,327.59,7.889,wkYmKJ7nfV8
131,and it continues in this Ortega it's,332.0,6.81,wkYmKJ7nfV8
132,noisy it has the same characteristics as,335.479,7.081,wkYmKJ7nfV8
133,before there is a bit of lag you do have,338.81,6.919,wkYmKJ7nfV8
134,to work the gears to get it going and,342.56,6.03,wkYmKJ7nfV8
135,power kicks in really after about 2000,345.729,7.16,wkYmKJ7nfV8
136,rpm you have to really,348.59,7.419,wkYmKJ7nfV8
137,walk this engine to get to triple digit,352.889,9.451,wkYmKJ7nfV8
138,speeds once there it cruises comfortably,356.009,8.43,wkYmKJ7nfV8
139,however overtakes do require gear,362.34,3.84,wkYmKJ7nfV8
140,changes especially if you're fully,364.439,3.72,wkYmKJ7nfV8
141,loaded other than that the clutch is,366.18,4.199,wkYmKJ7nfV8
142,light and easy the gearbox has a short,368.159,4.081,wkYmKJ7nfV8
143,positive throw and is light enough to,370.379,4.35,wkYmKJ7nfV8
144,use as well so overall drive in a,372.24,4.979,wkYmKJ7nfV8
145,relaxed manner and it feels just fine,374.729,5.94,wkYmKJ7nfV8
146,it just doesn't like to be hard the,377.219,7.76,wkYmKJ7nfV8
147,steering has more heft now,380.669,4.31,wkYmKJ7nfV8
148,and overall the car just feels more,386.02,9.45,wkYmKJ7nfV8
149,solid more stable more planted whether,388.629,10.801,wkYmKJ7nfV8
150,you're going around the corners or,395.47,6.509,wkYmKJ7nfV8
151,whether it's higher speeds in a straight,399.43,7.5,wkYmKJ7nfV8
152,line your feels more impressive,401.979,7.081,wkYmKJ7nfV8
153,now and out on the road it actually,406.93,3.87,wkYmKJ7nfV8
154,gives you the feeling of being a bigger,409.06,4.259,wkYmKJ7nfV8
155,MPD after finding out what it was like,410.8,4.29,wkYmKJ7nfV8
156,to drive it was time to hop over to the,413.319,3.871,wkYmKJ7nfV8
157,backseat to see what it's like for the,415.09,6.329,wkYmKJ7nfV8
158,passengers the increased dimensions can,417.19,5.849,wkYmKJ7nfV8
159,be felt here in the backseat you have,421.419,3.81,wkYmKJ7nfV8
160,more room there's more legroom the bench,423.039,4.35,wkYmKJ7nfV8
161,is wider so a third passenger will fit,425.229,4.201,wkYmKJ7nfV8
162,in very very easily and of course the,427.389,3.301,wkYmKJ7nfV8
163,flat floorboard means,429.43,3.479,wkYmKJ7nfV8
164,third passenger has enough legroom as,430.69,5.159,wkYmKJ7nfV8
165,well these large windows make it nice,432.909,4.891,wkYmKJ7nfV8
166,and open and airy you sit high you've,435.849,4.62,wkYmKJ7nfV8
167,got good visibility to the front and of,437.8,4.32,wkYmKJ7nfV8
168,course you've got the blower's here for,440.469,3.51,wkYmKJ7nfV8
169,the rear seat a little close to the head,442.12,4.289,wkYmKJ7nfV8
170,but fact of the matter is they will keep,443.979,5.22,wkYmKJ7nfV8
171,you cool well space is one of the things,446.409,4.471,wkYmKJ7nfV8
172,that's necessary to be comfortable in,449.199,3.481,wkYmKJ7nfV8
173,the back seat what's also important is,450.88,5.159,wkYmKJ7nfV8
174,the right quality now the right quality,452.68,5.01,wkYmKJ7nfV8
175,of the Ertiga is actually quite good,456.039,3.6,wkYmKJ7nfV8
176,there's a bit of underlying firmness,457.69,4.469,wkYmKJ7nfV8
177,when the cars empty but when it's fully,459.639,5.191,wkYmKJ7nfV8
178,loaded that goes away just absorbs bumps,462.159,5.701,wkYmKJ7nfV8
179,and potholes really well so overall you,464.83,4.949,wkYmKJ7nfV8
180,know with the space and a good ride,467.86,4.29,wkYmKJ7nfV8
181,quality this back seat is a very,469.779,6.211,wkYmKJ7nfV8
182,comfortable place to be in the Artic I,472.15,5.759,wkYmKJ7nfV8
183,was taking all the right boxes and next,475.99,3.87,wkYmKJ7nfV8
184,up I hopped into the petrol which has,477.909,4.951,wkYmKJ7nfV8
185,the K 15 1.5 litre that we have seen in,479.86,5.429,wkYmKJ7nfV8
186,the ciass the petrol has two variants a,482.86,5.22,wkYmKJ7nfV8
187,manual and an auto but we focused on the,485.289,6.24,wkYmKJ7nfV8
188,auto since its new now I'm in the petrol,488.08,5.55,wkYmKJ7nfV8
189,Auto that's right the Ertiga gets an,491.529,5.431,wkYmKJ7nfV8
190,auto box now it's a 4-speed and it,493.63,5.21,wkYmKJ7nfV8
191,actually works quite well,496.96,6.209,wkYmKJ7nfV8
192,shifting quite smoothly gentle dabs on,498.84,6.129,wkYmKJ7nfV8
193,the throttle bring up down shifts and,503.169,4.171,wkYmKJ7nfV8
194,they happen quite quickly so the gearbox,504.969,5.401,wkYmKJ7nfV8
195,works really well you have the different,507.34,6.54,wkYmKJ7nfV8
196,modes that you can use when it is in,510.37,5.24,wkYmKJ7nfV8
197,overdrive mode even,513.88,3.5,wkYmKJ7nfV8
198,gentle dab on the throttle will bring up,515.61,4.83,wkYmKJ7nfV8
199,a downshift because it's generally,517.38,5.01,wkYmKJ7nfV8
200,shifting gears up much quicker and,520.44,4.56,wkYmKJ7nfV8
201,keeping you driving in a very economical,522.39,6.05,wkYmKJ7nfV8
202,manner however switch the overdrive off,525.0,6.69,wkYmKJ7nfV8
203,and then it pulls much more stronger in,528.44,5.62,wkYmKJ7nfV8
204,each gear and it doesn't shift every,531.69,9.42,wkYmKJ7nfV8
205,time you accelerate a bit you also have,534.06,10.33,wkYmKJ7nfV8
206,the low mode where,541.11,5.68,wkYmKJ7nfV8
207,if I extend my foot it'll just keep,544.39,4.26,wkYmKJ7nfV8
208,pulling and pulling and pulling and,546.79,5.64,wkYmKJ7nfV8
209,won't shift till I want to a handy,548.65,5.7,wkYmKJ7nfV8
210,feature if you're traveling with a full,552.43,4.29,wkYmKJ7nfV8
211,load maybe up a hill and you want to,554.35,6.42,wkYmKJ7nfV8
212,hold the gear the petrol engine is,556.72,6.12,wkYmKJ7nfV8
213,silent at idle and feels refined enough,560.77,4.56,wkYmKJ7nfV8
214,at low revs but once you press hard down,562.84,4.29,wkYmKJ7nfV8
215,on the throttle then it does become,565.33,5.37,wkYmKJ7nfV8
216,portable this petrol engine feels pretty,567.13,7.56,wkYmKJ7nfV8
217,similar to what it does in the sea as it,570.7,5.91,wkYmKJ7nfV8
218,pulls off the line cleanly and it's got,574.69,5.94,wkYmKJ7nfV8
219,a bit of a flat mid-range but overall it,576.61,5.82,wkYmKJ7nfV8
220,gets up to triple digit speeds quite,580.63,4.2,wkYmKJ7nfV8
221,nicely easy driving in a relaxed manner,582.43,6.9,wkYmKJ7nfV8
222,without pushing it too hard and honestly,584.83,8.1,wkYmKJ7nfV8
223,it does really well and overall it feels,589.33,6.29,wkYmKJ7nfV8
224,like the better of the two engines,592.93,5.55,wkYmKJ7nfV8
225,overall the Ortega has grown and it,595.62,7.23,wkYmKJ7nfV8
226,feels like a far more mature product now,598.48,4.37,wkYmKJ7nfV8
227,the article has retained some of the,604.04,4.27,wkYmKJ7nfV8
228,weaknesses that Arad earlier like the,606.45,4.23,wkYmKJ7nfV8
229,diesel engine and even the petrol is,608.31,3.96,wkYmKJ7nfV8
230,really not exciting but though,610.68,4.11,wkYmKJ7nfV8
231,lackluster both engines do the job and,612.27,4.77,wkYmKJ7nfV8
232,they easy enough to drive and let's face,614.79,4.26,wkYmKJ7nfV8
233,it this segment is far more about,617.04,3.78,wkYmKJ7nfV8
234,practicality than it is about anything,619.05,4.56,wkYmKJ7nfV8
235,else and that is where the Ertiga really,620.82,5.31,wkYmKJ7nfV8
236,scores big the interiors have grown and,623.61,4.56,wkYmKJ7nfV8
237,are more spacious now of course it has,626.13,4.8,wkYmKJ7nfV8
238,that 7 seater option the integers feel,628.17,4.74,wkYmKJ7nfV8
239,more premium you get more features and,630.93,4.52,wkYmKJ7nfV8
240,it was always a comfortable car to be in,632.91,5.13,wkYmKJ7nfV8
241,so now it's more appealing to the,635.45,5.079,wkYmKJ7nfV8
242,personal buyer and of course the Ertiga,638.04,5.13,wkYmKJ7nfV8
243,is great value as well the fact remains,640.529,4.831,wkYmKJ7nfV8
244,that for the large Indian family there,643.17,3.51,wkYmKJ7nfV8
245,isn't a seven-seater,645.36,4.08,wkYmKJ7nfV8
246,that is this premium and this practical,646.68,5.72,wkYmKJ7nfV8
247,at this price point,649.44,2.96,wkYmKJ7nfV8
248,[Music],653.47,6.71,wkYmKJ7nfV8
249,[Laughter],655.98,4.2,wkYmKJ7nfV8
0,this is what we are filming today and,0.32,5.28,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
1,yes as no doubt many of you will say,3.12,6.32,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
2,it is an updated tuv 300 but mahindra,5.6,7.119,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
3,called it the bolero neo yes they have,9.44,3.84,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
4,named it,12.719,4.081,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
5,after this guy over here now the bolero,13.28,5.839,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
6,may be simple and basic but that would,16.8,3.84,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
7,be missing the point you see it's,19.119,3.841,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
8,supposed to be a rugged reliable go,20.64,4.0,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
9,anywhere vehicle,22.96,3.92,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
10,built to take on the rough and tumble of,24.64,3.68,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
11,the country around us,26.88,4.0,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
12,and it does that incredibly well just,28.32,4.48,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
13,ask the thousands of owners around the,30.88,2.96,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
14,country,32.8,2.88,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
15,but mahindra say there's an increasing,33.84,3.76,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
16,number of them that want an,35.68,4.879,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
17,added layer of style and comfort and,37.6,4.4,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
18,that's what they say,40.559,4.081,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
19,is offered in the neo so let's take a,42.0,3.039,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
20,look,44.64,3.919,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
21,and begin with the style,45.039,6.241,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
22,on the whole the design is more tuv but,48.559,4.801,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
23,mahindra have added a few bolero,51.28,5.919,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
24,elements to help with the association,53.36,3.839,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
25,now over at the front yes the,57.6,3.04,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
26,rectangular headlights,59.199,3.441,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
27,are featured and prominently they do,60.64,3.2,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
28,have a new drl,62.64,3.28,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
29,signature the grille of course the,63.84,3.92,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
30,typical mahindra grille is present,65.92,4.0,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
31,and the bumper over here gets the kind,67.76,3.76,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
32,of slatted,69.92,6.08,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
33,or the sloping cuts on the lower edge,71.52,6.72,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
34,moving over to the side you probably may,76.0,4.0,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
35,not notice this on the camera,78.24,3.919,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
36,but it does look a little shorter and,80.0,3.36,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
37,that's because it is,82.159,2.881,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
38,mahindra tellers they've lowered the,83.36,3.52,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
39,body by about 20 mm,85.04,4.24,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
40,and the bonnet another 20 mm further,86.88,4.16,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
41,still now how they've done this,89.28,4.159,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
42,is they've just lowered the body onto,91.04,3.36,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
43,the chassis so,93.439,2.561,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
44,the chassis and the ground clearance,94.4,4.0,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
45,they say remains the same,96.0,4.56,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
46,the alloys you get a new pattern and,98.4,4.16,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
47,they look quite smart and go with the,100.56,4.32,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
48,kind of upright and straight lined edges,102.56,4.0,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
49,around the car,104.88,4.16,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
50,one addition is this thick molding now,106.56,4.8,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
51,this is a typical bolero signature,109.04,4.079,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
52,which they've added bringing in that,111.36,4.079,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
53,boleroness because it needs that to,113.119,5.6,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
54,carry off the new nameplate,115.439,5.441,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
55,now what remains as you can see is the,118.719,3.76,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
56,sloping b-pillar,120.88,3.68,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
57,i'm personally not a fan of it but there,122.479,3.28,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
58,are people who like it it's,124.56,3.12,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
59,well an aesthetic choice there is one,125.759,3.92,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
60,thing though when you do open the door,127.68,3.68,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
61,it tends to come a little close to your,129.679,3.841,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
62,face,131.36,3.84,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
63,over at the rear things are pretty,133.52,3.2,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
64,similar to the tuv,135.2,3.679,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
65,though the x-shaped wheel cover now,136.72,4.159,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
66,carries the bolero branding,138.879,4.241,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
67,the tail lights are a little different,140.879,3.921,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
68,and the rest of it of course yeah you do,143.12,2.08,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
69,have,144.8,3.36,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
70,a spoiler atop on the higher variant and,145.2,6.08,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
71,your grab handle here to open the hatch,148.16,6.32,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
72,which you can see here has two jump,151.28,4.0,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
73,seats,154.48,2.96,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
74,they are though not the best place to,155.28,3.039,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
75,sit as,157.44,2.159,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
76,i have sawmill with me and we'll,158.319,3.841,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
77,demonstrate,159.599,2.561,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
78,[Music],163.66,4.02,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
79,so yes as you can see space at the rear,164.879,3.921,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
80,is quite tight,167.68,3.199,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
81,samuel and i do have to kind of adjust,168.8,3.36,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
82,our feet and knees,170.879,3.44,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
83,and make sure we fit here having said,172.16,3.04,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
84,that though,174.319,3.84,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
85,uh it is a little bit broader and just a,175.2,4.24,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
86,smidge in more headroom,178.159,3.281,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
87,than the regular bolero now over the,179.44,3.12,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
88,regular bolero,181.44,3.92,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
89,you also get these butterfly windows,182.56,4.24,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
90,here which will help with,185.36,4.4,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
91,ventilation having said all this though,186.8,3.519,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
92,remember,189.76,2.8,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
93,space isn't really the problem rather,190.319,3.761,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
94,it's a matter of safety,192.56,3.44,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
95,there are no seat belts and in case of a,194.08,3.92,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
96,crash this isn't the right place,196.0,4.48,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
97,or the position to be in so we'd suggest,198.0,4.48,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
98,you use it as a boot only,200.48,5.44,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
99,and stick to the seats up ahead,202.48,5.679,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
100,over here at the rear or in the second,205.92,3.36,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
101,row as you can see,208.159,3.521,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
102,space isn't all that generous yeah i do,209.28,3.92,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
103,have about a little,211.68,4.0,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
104,leg room for for for me here this seat,213.2,4.319,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
105,is adjusted to my driving position i'm,215.68,3.44,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
106,about five foot eight,217.519,3.521,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
107,and yeah there is some space underneath,219.12,4.0,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
108,there too that you can tuck in your feet,221.04,3.6,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
109,on the whole though it doesn't give you,223.12,3.119,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
110,that sense of openness,224.64,5.2,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
111,and kind of like a big suv feel,226.239,5.681,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
112,the windows do do compensate for that,229.84,3.92,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
113,because they offer you a very nice view,231.92,2.56,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
114,outside,233.76,2.559,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
115,and the sloping pillars that i didn't,234.48,3.119,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
116,like of course,236.319,3.441,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
117,they do help now in that they don't,237.599,4.241,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
118,block or obstruct your view,239.76,5.119,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
119,headroom is quite a lot and,241.84,4.479,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
120,will be more than sufficient for most,244.879,3.681,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
121,people and yes you do have an armrest,246.319,4.161,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
122,here as well too,248.56,3.52,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
123,over the regular bolero the seat,250.48,3.839,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
124,cushioning is firmer and feels better,252.08,3.68,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
125,and more supportive,254.319,4.801,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
126,and that holds through at the front too,255.76,5.36,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
127,now here at the front uh things are,259.12,4.32,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
128,quite comfy the seats do feel fairly,261.12,3.28,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
129,supportive,263.44,4.24,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
130,and the armrests here fall to hand quite,264.4,3.92,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
131,nicely,267.68,2.079,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
132,and you can reach comfortably for the,268.32,3.68,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
133,gear lever in terms of,269.759,4.401,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
134,the dash and equipment though things are,272.0,3.6,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
135,pretty similar to the tuv,274.16,3.599,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
136,earlier though the ip here features a,275.6,5.44,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
137,new 3.5 inch tft display,277.759,5.281,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
138,the dashboard yes mahindra say it has,281.04,3.84,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
139,been designed by pininfarina,283.04,3.84,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
140,it does look quite nice and symmetrical,284.88,3.12,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
141,and balanced,286.88,3.36,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
142,uh in terms of equipment you do have the,288.0,3.12,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
143,touchscreen,290.24,2.88,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
144,disappointingly though it doesn't have,291.12,4.24,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
145,android auto and apple carplay,293.12,4.96,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
146,uh the other bits around the car yes you,295.36,3.76,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
147,do have,298.08,3.839,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
148,ac controls down here and you do have an,299.12,4.56,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
149,eco mode for the ac,301.919,4.321,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
150,this car also features a micro hybrid or,303.68,4.799,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
151,a start stop technology,306.24,4.399,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
152,other bits there are storage areas up,308.479,4.0,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
153,here the glove box,310.639,4.241,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
154,is just about okay uh there's a little,312.479,3.521,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
155,pen holder,314.88,3.759,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
156,and there are a few cubby holes here and,316.0,4.479,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
157,that pretty much makes up the interior,318.639,2.56,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
158,storage,320.479,2.641,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
159,space power window switches,321.199,3.84,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
160,interestingly are in the center,323.12,3.68,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
161,so they're not on the doors here there's,325.039,3.841,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
162,just one console for both you and the,326.8,4.32,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
163,passenger,328.88,4.48,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
164,as for the equipment and variants,331.12,3.359,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
165,mahindra has launched,333.36,3.2,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
166,three variants and the fourth that will,334.479,3.601,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
167,add on a mechanically locking,336.56,2.479,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
168,differential,338.08,3.36,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
169,will come in a bit later i'll get to,339.039,4.0,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
170,what the mechanical locking differential,341.44,2.08,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
171,does,343.039,9.921,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
172,at the end of the video,343.52,12.32,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
173,now as far as driving the neo goes well,352.96,4.88,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
174,there's a lot to expect from the engine,355.84,3.84,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
175,especially since mahinda do such a,357.84,5.359,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
176,fantastic job of their power trains,359.68,6.32,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
177,so the engine is the familiar 1.5 liter,363.199,4.0,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
178,three cylinder,366.0,4.16,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
179,mhox unit and it continues to make the,367.199,4.801,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
180,same amount of power and torque,370.16,5.44,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
181,as the tuv did though for the bs6 norms,372.0,5.36,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
182,that this car is now launched with of,375.6,2.719,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
183,course,377.36,3.839,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
184,they do have an evgt and that has,378.319,4.641,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
185,improved the drivability,381.199,3.361,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
186,just the touch bit of course it was,382.96,3.679,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
187,always good and now on the neo,384.56,4.88,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
188,it's that little bit better power comes,386.639,4.241,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
189,in also quite early at,389.44,4.72,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
190,about 1500 you get a nice strong surge,390.88,5.28,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
191,and then it tapers off at about three,394.16,4.319,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
192,and a half thousand,396.16,4.4,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
193,and well you'd have to up shift because,398.479,3.761,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
194,there's really no point going beyond,400.56,3.52,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
195,4000,402.24,3.44,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
196,in terms of refinement the engine is,404.08,3.36,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
197,smooth but sound levels are quite,405.68,3.519,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
198,audible inside the cabin,407.44,3.52,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
199,but it's something you can look fast on,409.199,3.44,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
200,this class of a vehicle,410.96,3.76,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
201,as some of you would have guessed we are,412.639,3.921,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
202,at the mahindra test track in pune,414.72,4.08,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
203,and it's a rather small and simple one,416.56,3.84,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
204,so we can't really say much about the,418.8,2.959,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
205,ride and handling,420.4,3.44,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
206,but the steering feel was well weighted,421.759,4.0,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
207,and there seems to be a little less body,423.84,5.359,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
208,roll compared to the tuv,425.759,3.44,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
209,so unfortunately we can't head out of,429.599,4.081,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
210,the plant,432.56,3.039,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
211,and really test the bolero over the kind,433.68,4.0,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
212,of terrain it would typically be used,435.599,3.921,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
213,but mahindra have a small little,437.68,3.04,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
214,off-road course for us,439.52,3.679,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
215,over here just to simulate a bit of,440.72,3.84,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
216,rough roads and,443.199,3.761,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
217,harsh conditions and yes the bolero does,444.56,3.84,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
218,perform expectedly,446.96,4.32,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
219,quite well obviously it is a controlled,448.4,3.6,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
220,environment,451.28,2.8,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
221,and things are designed to make sure the,452.0,4.24,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
222,bolero goes through all of them easily,454.08,4.72,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
223,but in doing so it does it in a very,456.24,4.0,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
224,effortless manner,458.8,4.399,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
225,and quite fuss free the chassis and the,460.24,4.48,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
226,suspension just takes up,463.199,4.56,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
227,everything quite well and i think it,464.72,4.8,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
228,should be really fine out on the rough,467.759,3.601,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
229,and tumble of our roads and,469.52,5.28,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
230,a little bit of the off-roads too,471.36,3.44,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
231,one thing that the bolero neo does have,475.12,3.519,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
232,though to help it off-road,477.12,4.24,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
233,is an automatic mechanically locking,478.639,3.68,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
234,differential,481.36,3.839,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
235,now what that is is for example like so,482.319,4.0,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
236,if i were to get,485.199,4.4,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
237,one wheel up in the air and,486.319,4.801,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
238,well the differential would obviously,489.599,4.0,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
239,just send the power out to the wheel up,491.12,4.96,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
240,in the air spinning it helplessly,493.599,4.16,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
241,the differential here would lock,496.08,3.44,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
242,automatically and send power to the,497.759,2.72,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
243,wheel on the ground,499.52,3.84,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
244,so as soon as the rpm increases there,500.479,3.84,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
245,you go,503.36,5.92,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
246,you have a lock and you get power,504.319,7.921,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
247,so the neo is quite capable but is it a,509.28,3.92,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
248,bolero,512.24,3.12,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
249,for sure the bolero is a model that is,513.2,4.16,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
250,rugged and it screams that out with its,515.36,3.52,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
251,style and character too,517.36,3.76,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
252,the neo style however does not convey,518.88,3.519,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
253,the same message,521.12,2.96,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
254,underneath though the neo's new,522.399,3.361,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
255,generation chassis is just,524.08,4.319,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
256,as tough if not tougher the engine is,525.76,5.04,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
257,the same and here it puts out more power,528.399,4.161,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
258,and then there's the cabin both are,530.8,4.32,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
259,similar in size but the neo is just so,532.56,3.92,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
260,much more refined,535.12,3.6,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
261,better put together and with a load of,536.48,4.16,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
262,extra equipment too,538.72,4.239,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
263,and what's more is the pricing in some,540.64,4.08,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
264,cities the neo is actually more,542.959,2.56,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
265,affordable,544.72,3.36,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
266,while in others the gap is only about 30,545.519,3.121,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
267,to 40,548.08,2.96,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
268,000 over so yes if you look past the,548.64,3.84,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
269,neos exteriors,551.04,5.359,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
270,you'll find quite a capable bolero,552.48,3.919,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
271,underneath,560.839,3.0,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
272,okay so as promised how do differentials,569.44,3.68,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
273,work,572.24,3.52,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
274,well in a straight line when i'm driving,573.12,3.76,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
275,like this,575.76,2.96,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
276,the engine power is going equally to,576.88,3.28,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
277,both wheels the left and the right,578.72,2.32,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
278,wheels,580.16,3.28,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
279,if however i were to take a turn then,581.04,3.359,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
280,the inner wheel,583.44,3.2,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
281,travels a smaller part and the outer,584.399,4.88,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
282,wheel needs to travel a larger part,586.64,4.08,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
283,and that's where the differential comes,589.279,4.321,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
284,in what it does is for instance like now,590.72,5.04,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
285,it's going to be sending a little less,593.6,4.0,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
286,power to the inner wheel and more to the,595.76,3.6,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
287,outer wheel,597.6,4.4,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
288,and it does that in a very simple,599.36,5.039,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
289,fashion it's a pure mechanical device,602.0,4.48,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
290,resistance on the inner wheel causes,604.399,3.68,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
291,some of the power to be transferred to,606.48,2.64,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
292,the outer wheel,608.079,3.361,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
293,and that's it that's quite simply it,609.12,4.159,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
294,very clever little device but it does,611.44,4.32,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
295,create a little bit of a problem,613.279,4.641,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
296,in off-road conditions there are times,615.76,3.759,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
297,when you could have a wheel up in the,617.92,2.159,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
298,air,619.519,2.161,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
299,and the differential would just send the,620.079,3.521,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
300,power to that wheel,621.68,4.719,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
301,and it would spin helplessly now what,623.6,3.52,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
302,you can do,626.399,2.641,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
303,is you can just break that wheel and,627.12,3.04,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
304,which is what is called,629.04,2.96,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
305,an electronic locking differential or a,630.16,3.359,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
306,brake locking differential,632.0,3.279,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
307,where the brake just stops the wheel,633.519,3.201,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
308,from rotating and therefore the,635.279,2.401,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
309,differential,636.72,2.64,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
310,sensing the resistance sends the power,637.68,3.599,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
311,down to the wheel on the ground,639.36,4.24,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
312,or you could also have a locking,641.279,3.761,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
313,differential a mechanically locking,643.6,2.16,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
314,differential,645.04,3.44,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
315,which is what we have on this bolero neo,645.76,3.68,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
316,interestingly,648.48,3.359,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
317,you don't have to select a lever or,649.44,3.2,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
318,anything,651.839,4.801,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
319,it engages automatically so for example,652.64,7.92,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
320,i'm gonna be getting onto,656.64,8.56,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
321,an axle twister like this,660.56,4.64,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
322,and now we have one wheel up,665.36,6.32,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
323,in the air the outer wheel is up in the,668.959,3.521,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
324,air,671.68,3.04,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
325,the inner wheel is down on the ground,672.48,4.08,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
326,and if i were to,674.72,5.359,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
327,rev you'll see as soon as the rpm,676.56,5.36,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
328,difference goes over 100,680.079,4.32,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
329,the mechanical lock will kick in and,681.92,3.76,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
330,we'll have power,684.399,3.521,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
331,you can actually feel that lock and that,685.68,3.68,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
332,engage engagement,687.92,4.8,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
333,and it's a bit harsh of course but,689.36,5.28,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
334,as i said it's a mechanical device so,692.72,4.08,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
335,you would probably feel,694.64,4.08,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
336,the engagement and that little bit of a,696.8,3.12,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
337,kick when the,698.72,5.119,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
338,lock does engage,699.92,3.919,Zn4Ntl-AyNA
0,[Music],1.86,9.659,P3zzRrKjxVI
1,so finally something that's not hen SUV,7.82,6.279,P3zzRrKjxVI
2,we have a hatchback to test and a very,11.519,4.711,P3zzRrKjxVI
3,important one at that this is the,14.099,4.861,P3zzRrKjxVI
4,Hyundai grand i10 Neos which is the,16.23,5.78,P3zzRrKjxVI
5,successor to the very popular grand i10,18.96,5.94,P3zzRrKjxVI
6,now the grand i10 isn't gonna go,22.01,4.839,P3zzRrKjxVI
7,anywhere soon this car is going to be,24.9,4.44,P3zzRrKjxVI
8,selling alongside the grand i10 but,26.849,5.581,P3zzRrKjxVI
9,obviously it's bigger it's more spacious,29.34,5.16,P3zzRrKjxVI
10,better equip and crucially it's a,32.43,4.649,P3zzRrKjxVI
11,segment higher and pitted directly,34.5,5.19,P3zzRrKjxVI
12,against the Swift in fact the Swift's,37.079,5.701,P3zzRrKjxVI
13,jugular is what Hyundai is going for,39.69,5.4,P3zzRrKjxVI
14,it's got a petrol option and a diesel,42.78,5.04,P3zzRrKjxVI
15,option like before but crucially you've,45.09,5.67,P3zzRrKjxVI
16,got AMT versions automatic versions for,47.82,5.1,P3zzRrKjxVI
17,both and now we've got both these cars,50.76,4.11,P3zzRrKjxVI
18,here in their pool to tell you what,52.92,4.31,P3zzRrKjxVI
19,they're about,54.87,2.36,P3zzRrKjxVI
20,[Music],58.18,3.079,P3zzRrKjxVI
21,but before I Drive off let's have a,65.36,4.09,P3zzRrKjxVI
22,closer look at what's new and if the,67.71,4.11,P3zzRrKjxVI
23,Neos which means more lives up to its,69.45,4.74,P3zzRrKjxVI
24,name for starters it's wider and longer,71.82,4.41,P3zzRrKjxVI
25,than the grand i10 and looks more,74.19,4.23,P3zzRrKjxVI
26,grown-up two gone is the two-part grille,76.23,4.2,P3zzRrKjxVI
27,and what you get is a massive single,78.42,4.17,P3zzRrKjxVI
28,grille which you can't miss and quite,80.43,5.37,P3zzRrKjxVI
29,frankly it looks a touch too big what,82.59,4.89,P3zzRrKjxVI
30,looks really cool are those boomerang,85.8,3.96,P3zzRrKjxVI
31,shaped DRL tucked away at the edge of,87.48,4.53,P3zzRrKjxVI
32,the grille and top variants also get,89.76,6.75,P3zzRrKjxVI
33,projector lights the sides get sharper,92.01,6.36,P3zzRrKjxVI
34,creases in the bodywork and the 15-inch,96.51,3.87,P3zzRrKjxVI
35,diamond cut alloys look terrific,98.37,4.35,P3zzRrKjxVI
36,another well-executed detail is the,100.38,4.08,P3zzRrKjxVI
37,textured blacked-out section in the,102.72,2.34,P3zzRrKjxVI
38,c-pillar,104.46,4.38,P3zzRrKjxVI
39,with G Iten embossed on one side move to,105.06,5.61,P3zzRrKjxVI
40,the rear and you'll notice the hyundai h,108.84,3.99,P3zzRrKjxVI
41,has gotten bigger and you will find a,110.67,4.17,P3zzRrKjxVI
42,shark fin antenna on the roof and,112.83,4.14,P3zzRrKjxVI
43,there's even a chrome strip at the base,114.84,4.92,P3zzRrKjxVI
44,of the tailgate the tail lamps however,116.97,5.4,P3zzRrKjxVI
45,are still a touch small so for sure the,119.76,4.5,P3zzRrKjxVI
46,Neos looks good but what's it like to,122.37,2.61,P3zzRrKjxVI
47,drive,124.26,11.969,P3zzRrKjxVI
48,[Music],124.98,11.249,P3zzRrKjxVI
49,now I've started out in the 1.2 patrol,136.24,6.01,P3zzRrKjxVI
50,manual and this variant is gonna form,139.88,5.46,P3zzRrKjxVI
51,the bulk of nior sales just like it was,142.25,5.4,P3zzRrKjxVI
52,with the grand i10 in fact this is the,145.34,5.49,P3zzRrKjxVI
53,same engine and transmission from the,147.65,5.1,P3zzRrKjxVI
54,grand i10 the only difference is that,150.83,5.01,P3zzRrKjxVI
55,this one is bs6 compliant it meets the,152.75,5.64,P3zzRrKjxVI
56,latest emission regulations now and,155.84,5.64,P3zzRrKjxVI
57,typically that comes with a penalty of,158.39,5.07,P3zzRrKjxVI
58,fuel consumption but in this car,161.48,5.13,P3zzRrKjxVI
59,this is actually one kpl more fuel,163.46,4.71,P3zzRrKjxVI
60,efficient and that's because it's,166.61,3.81,P3zzRrKjxVI
61,lighter it's 30 to 40 kilos lighter,168.17,4.71,P3zzRrKjxVI
62,because they're using more tensile steel,170.42,4.14,P3zzRrKjxVI
63,in this high tensile strength steel,172.88,4.41,P3zzRrKjxVI
64,which is lighter and stronger and also,174.56,5.28,P3zzRrKjxVI
65,the engine has been more finely tuned,177.29,5.01,P3zzRrKjxVI
66,the ECU has been more finely tuned so,179.84,5.7,P3zzRrKjxVI
67,Hyundai has managed to actually give,182.3,6.24,P3zzRrKjxVI
68,even better fuel efficiency on the test,185.54,7.62,P3zzRrKjxVI
69,cycle but has to move to be s6 impacted,188.54,7.5,P3zzRrKjxVI
70,performance now this one point to petrol,193.16,5.28,P3zzRrKjxVI
71,it's great in the city it's quite,196.04,5.7,P3zzRrKjxVI
72,responsive it's good on path throttle,198.44,6.39,P3zzRrKjxVI
73,you can just amble along you really,201.74,5.79,P3zzRrKjxVI
74,don't feel it's underpowered it keeps up,204.83,5.7,P3zzRrKjxVI
75,with the traffic so as a city car it,207.53,6.24,P3zzRrKjxVI
76,does quite well but the minute you get,210.53,5.4,P3zzRrKjxVI
77,on the highway and you want more out of,213.77,4.73,P3zzRrKjxVI
78,it you are greeted by what is a very,215.93,4.98,P3zzRrKjxVI
79,gutless pot of men there's just,218.5,4.45,P3zzRrKjxVI
80,absolutely nothing lowdown in the revs,220.91,4.56,P3zzRrKjxVI
81,you have to rev the hell out of this,222.95,5.1,P3zzRrKjxVI
82,engine wring its neck to get the most,225.47,5.1,P3zzRrKjxVI
83,out of it so really on the highway you,228.05,4.32,P3zzRrKjxVI
84,will be pushing this,230.57,5.46,P3zzRrKjxVI
85,engin quite a bit and quite frankly it,232.37,7.05,P3zzRrKjxVI
86,doesn't have the zing of the suzuki,236.03,5.81,P3zzRrKjxVI
87,k-series which you get at the Swift and,239.42,6.569,P3zzRrKjxVI
88,now to check out how it handles now with,241.84,6.64,P3zzRrKjxVI
89,the stiffer chassis you can soften the,245.989,4.651,P3zzRrKjxVI
90,suspension of bitter without having an,248.48,5.849,P3zzRrKjxVI
91,impact on body control and the nias has,250.64,6.48,P3zzRrKjxVI
92,a slightly softer setup over the grand,254.329,5.761,P3zzRrKjxVI
93,i10 it's a little bit more pliant it's a,257.12,5.28,P3zzRrKjxVI
94,little bit more plush but you still get,260.09,4.71,P3zzRrKjxVI
95,a little bit of vertical movement over,262.4,6.81,P3zzRrKjxVI
96,these undulations on this road it's it's,264.8,8.22,P3zzRrKjxVI
97,fairly planted it's quite secure you can,269.21,6.65,P3zzRrKjxVI
98,cruise happily at three digit speeds,273.02,6.36,P3zzRrKjxVI
99,just that the steering isn't super,275.86,5.11,P3zzRrKjxVI
100,accurate you have to make small,279.38,3.36,P3zzRrKjxVI
101,Corrections while going through these,280.97,5.819,P3zzRrKjxVI
102,sweepers over here again this car isn't,282.74,6.149,P3zzRrKjxVI
103,made for the highway it's been tuned for,286.789,3.961,P3zzRrKjxVI
104,the city where the light steering is a,288.889,2.461,P3zzRrKjxVI
105,boon,290.75,3.68,P3zzRrKjxVI
106,but if you are taking it out of town,291.35,5.97,P3zzRrKjxVI
107,it's a car that's it's quite comfortable,294.43,6.45,P3zzRrKjxVI
108,at speeds as well,297.32,3.56,P3zzRrKjxVI
109,quite clearly this is a car that's,301.24,4.18,P3zzRrKjxVI
110,designed to be a happy city commuter and,303.29,4.46,P3zzRrKjxVI
111,not one that encourages spirited driving,305.42,5.43,P3zzRrKjxVI
112,so is the diesel Neos any different,307.75,7.18,P3zzRrKjxVI
113,I flipped into the MT variant to see,310.85,6.99,P3zzRrKjxVI
114,what it's like you get an automatic,314.93,4.83,P3zzRrKjxVI
115,option for both the petrol and diesel,317.84,5.36,P3zzRrKjxVI
116,engines and right now I am in the diesel,319.76,6.81,P3zzRrKjxVI
117,automatic what's interesting is that the,323.2,5.5,P3zzRrKjxVI
118,diesel and the petrol both come with a,326.57,2.91,P3zzRrKjxVI
119,MTS,328.7,2.79,P3zzRrKjxVI
120,and not the torque converter of the,329.48,4.47,P3zzRrKjxVI
121,grand i10 now in terms of hierarchy a,331.49,4.92,P3zzRrKjxVI
122,torque converter is normally superior,333.95,4.68,P3zzRrKjxVI
123,it's smoother EMTs are considered the,336.41,4.74,P3zzRrKjxVI
124,poor man's automatic but quite frankly,338.63,5.19,P3zzRrKjxVI
125,for our conditions EMTs are making more,341.15,4.95,P3zzRrKjxVI
126,sense firstly because they're far more,343.82,3.78,P3zzRrKjxVI
127,fuel efficient in fact one of the,346.1,4.5,P3zzRrKjxVI
128,reasons why the grand i10 auto wasn't,347.6,5.04,P3zzRrKjxVI
129,popular is because it doesn't fuel the,350.6,3.84,P3zzRrKjxVI
130,other thing also is that there is a big,352.64,5.13,P3zzRrKjxVI
131,cost advantage the only real downside is,354.44,5.1,P3zzRrKjxVI
132,and that's the biggest downside is just,357.77,4.29,P3zzRrKjxVI
133,the way the power is delivered AMT is,359.54,5.76,P3zzRrKjxVI
134,not typically as smooth as the,362.06,5.43,P3zzRrKjxVI
135,conventional torque converters you do,365.3,4.32,P3zzRrKjxVI
136,get a bit of that head nod or that,367.49,5.01,P3zzRrKjxVI
137,interruption in power and on this,369.62,5.49,P3zzRrKjxVI
138,version Hyundai has improved it quite a,372.5,4.5,P3zzRrKjxVI
139,bit we thought first on the Santro but,375.11,5.01,P3zzRrKjxVI
140,it's really been improved further after,377.0,6.18,P3zzRrKjxVI
141,that now driving into they proved that,380.12,5.49,P3zzRrKjxVI
142,pause between gear shifts doesn't really,383.18,5.28,P3zzRrKjxVI
143,bother you too much EMTs have come a,385.61,4.95,P3zzRrKjxVI
144,long way and Hyun dies AMT is,388.46,7.11,P3zzRrKjxVI
145,particularly good it's only when you're,390.56,7.05,P3zzRrKjxVI
146,going from first to second at the head,395.57,3.309,P3zzRrKjxVI
147,not,397.61,5.669,P3zzRrKjxVI
148,is most pronounced,398.879,4.4,P3zzRrKjxVI
149,this three cylinder diesel engine,404.52,4.119,P3zzRrKjxVI
150,developed seventy-five horsepower like,406.96,4.44,P3zzRrKjxVI
151,before and isn't the most refined with,408.639,5.58,P3zzRrKjxVI
152,that noticeable throm at idle it's,411.4,4.829,P3zzRrKjxVI
153,reasonably punchy but again runs out of,414.219,4.651,P3zzRrKjxVI
154,steam on the highway but surprisingly,416.229,4.59,P3zzRrKjxVI
155,the diesel variant felt better than the,418.87,4.139,P3zzRrKjxVI
156,petrol Neos on these monsoon ravaged,420.819,4.141,P3zzRrKjxVI
157,roads I was quite surprised by the,423.009,7.41,P3zzRrKjxVI
158,pounding this car could take now on,424.96,7.53,P3zzRrKjxVI
159,rough roads I prefer the diesel,430.419,4.02,P3zzRrKjxVI
160,basically for two reasons because,432.49,5.039,P3zzRrKjxVI
161,firstly to accommodate the heavier,434.439,5.611,P3zzRrKjxVI
162,diesel engine the front suspension has,437.529,5.431,P3zzRrKjxVI
163,been beefed up which is good and the,440.05,5.399,P3zzRrKjxVI
164,other reason is that on this AMT variant,442.96,4.829,P3zzRrKjxVI
165,which doesn't come in a top spec you get,445.449,5.701,P3zzRrKjxVI
166,a smaller 14-inch wheel and with that is,447.789,6.69,P3zzRrKjxVI
167,a tire with a higher profile or a taller,451.15,5.16,P3zzRrKjxVI
168,sidewall and that really cushions you,454.479,5.671,P3zzRrKjxVI
169,against the shocks and just how well,456.31,5.819,P3zzRrKjxVI
170,does the cabin pamper you I'm back in,460.15,3.479,P3zzRrKjxVI
171,the top spec petrol to see how,462.129,4.111,P3zzRrKjxVI
172,comfortable and well-equipped it is so,463.629,5.28,P3zzRrKjxVI
173,I'm inside the grand i10 Neos and like,466.24,4.859,P3zzRrKjxVI
174,most human dry cabins this is a nice,468.909,4.771,P3zzRrKjxVI
175,place to be it's quite a refreshing,471.099,4.44,P3zzRrKjxVI
176,design in here firstly is the choice of,473.68,4.5,P3zzRrKjxVI
177,colors you've got this grey and white,475.539,4.53,P3zzRrKjxVI
178,kind of theme even from the seats even,478.18,3.87,P3zzRrKjxVI
179,to the dashboard you've got some,480.069,4.081,P3zzRrKjxVI
180,interesting texture over here a bit of a,482.05,3.6,P3zzRrKjxVI
181,design elements,484.15,6.06,P3zzRrKjxVI
182,I love the the rotary vents over here,485.65,6.75,P3zzRrKjxVI
183,they have a nice quality feel to it,490.21,4.949,P3zzRrKjxVI
184,the instrumentation again quite unique,492.4,4.68,P3zzRrKjxVI
185,you've got an analogue tach and a,495.159,5.19,P3zzRrKjxVI
186,digital speedo over all plastics I have,497.08,5.759,P3zzRrKjxVI
187,to say are not absolutely brilliant in,500.349,4.801,P3zzRrKjxVI
188,fact I dare say the Santhosh plastics in,502.839,4.021,P3zzRrKjxVI
189,certain areas feel better but let's not,505.15,3.629,P3zzRrKjxVI
190,forget that this isn't a premium hatch,506.86,4.049,P3zzRrKjxVI
191,it's a mid hatch so obviously some,508.779,3.901,P3zzRrKjxVI
192,things are going to be dumbed down even,510.909,4.17,P3zzRrKjxVI
193,in terms of equipment you've not got all,512.68,5.339,P3zzRrKjxVI
194,the toys but you have got which is a,515.079,5.15,P3zzRrKjxVI
195,first in class,518.019,5.31,P3zzRrKjxVI
196,wireless charging the 8 inch touchscreen,520.229,5.35,P3zzRrKjxVI
197,is the largest in class and placed high,523.329,4.801,P3zzRrKjxVI
198,it's easy to operate and yes apple,525.579,4.38,P3zzRrKjxVI
199,carplay and android auto is there,528.13,4.29,P3zzRrKjxVI
200,overall the Neos doesn't fare too badly,529.959,4.351,P3zzRrKjxVI
201,on the equipment front but does miss out,532.42,3.81,P3zzRrKjxVI
202,on things like auto headlamps and,534.31,5.54,P3zzRrKjxVI
203,rain sensing wipers which rivals offer,536.23,6.73,P3zzRrKjxVI
204,[Music],539.85,3.11,P3zzRrKjxVI
205,[Music],546.39,5.739,P3zzRrKjxVI
206,let's check out the backseat,548.36,3.769,P3zzRrKjxVI
207,now the sense of space in the backseat,554.84,5.08,P3zzRrKjxVI
208,well it's it's really really good,557.61,5.25,P3zzRrKjxVI
209,and that's not just because the legroom,559.92,5.52,P3zzRrKjxVI
210,is impressive or the Headroom is very,562.86,5.49,P3zzRrKjxVI
211,generous even for tall people but the,565.44,5.37,P3zzRrKjxVI
212,light colors inside which gives a sense,568.35,5.82,P3zzRrKjxVI
213,of airiness the seat also good under,570.81,5.67,P3zzRrKjxVI
214,thigh support and the base is canted up,574.17,3.72,P3zzRrKjxVI
215,so that also helps,576.48,4.59,P3zzRrKjxVI
216,you've got rear aircon vents but overall,577.89,5.91,P3zzRrKjxVI
217,the seat is quite flat it is actually a,581.07,3.36,P3zzRrKjxVI
218,bench,583.8,2.58,P3zzRrKjxVI
219,there's no armrests there are no proper,584.43,3.87,P3zzRrKjxVI
220,contours so it doesn't really hold you,586.38,2.22,P3zzRrKjxVI
221,in,588.3,2.13,P3zzRrKjxVI
222,but clearly this has been designed for,588.6,4.65,P3zzRrKjxVI
223,three people let's not forget that this,590.43,5.88,P3zzRrKjxVI
224,is a family hatch and you and I want to,593.25,5.01,P3zzRrKjxVI
225,pack in as many people as it can and,596.31,3.96,P3zzRrKjxVI
226,actually if you compare this to the,598.26,4.11,P3zzRrKjxVI
227,grand i10 and even the competition,600.27,5.37,P3zzRrKjxVI
228,there's far more space in the new neos,602.37,5.55,P3zzRrKjxVI
229,it's a practical cabin tube with,605.64,4.11,P3zzRrKjxVI
230,generous door pockets a decent-sized,607.92,3.99,P3zzRrKjxVI
231,glovebox which has a very useful shelf,609.75,4.71,P3zzRrKjxVI
232,above it the 260 litre boot is,611.91,4.26,P3zzRrKjxVI
233,marginally bigger than before but not as,614.46,3.84,P3zzRrKjxVI
234,big as the Swift's the back seat flips,616.17,3.81,P3zzRrKjxVI
235,down but the release straps are a bit,618.3,6.06,P3zzRrKjxVI
236,fiddly to use so then to sum up should,619.98,6.66,P3zzRrKjxVI
237,you buy an EOS is it that much better,624.36,4.32,P3zzRrKjxVI
238,than the grand i10 and is it a better,626.64,4.32,P3zzRrKjxVI
239,alternative to the Swift well it doesn't,628.68,4.32,P3zzRrKjxVI
240,quite have the Swift's individualistic,630.96,4.26,P3zzRrKjxVI
241,appeal and nor is it as much fun to,633.0,5.07,P3zzRrKjxVI
242,drive but to live with the Neos with its,635.22,5.13,P3zzRrKjxVI
243,easy driving manners comfortable and,638.07,6.29,P3zzRrKjxVI
244,practical cabin comes out on top,640.35,4.01,P3zzRrKjxVI
245,this new grand i10 is more of an,644.689,4.36,P3zzRrKjxVI
246,evolution than a revolution but it has a,647.1,4.049,P3zzRrKjxVI
247,well-rounded versatility that makes it,649.049,6.26,P3zzRrKjxVI
248,much more of a complete package now,651.149,4.16,P3zzRrKjxVI
249,[Music],658.39,6.71,P3zzRrKjxVI
250,[Laughter],660.9,4.2,P3zzRrKjxVI
