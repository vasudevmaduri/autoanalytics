114,liter diesel engine that we've seen on,328.84,4.17,FmHI0ar0EvE

116,amount of turbo lag low down in the rev,333.01,3.09,FmHI0ar0EvE
117,range and then there's a sudden rush of,334.48,5.01,FmHI0ar0EvE
118,power but things are little bit better,336.1,4.65,FmHI0ar0EvE
119,here on the vitara brezza because the,339.49,3.27,FmHI0ar0EvE
120,gearing is really quite smart so even,340.75,4.05,FmHI0ar0EvE
121,when the speeds in the revs drop you do,342.76,3.99,FmHI0ar0EvE
122,get a decent amount of drivability to,344.8,3.96,FmHI0ar0EvE
123,ambling around the city shouldn't be,346.75,3.87,FmHI0ar0EvE
124,difficult unless and until you really,348.76,5.66,FmHI0ar0EvE
125,let the rev strong,350.62,3.8,FmHI0ar0EvE
126,while to change base you can rely on the,356.169,4.141,FmHI0ar0EvE
127,light action of the clutch while the,358.599,4.111,FmHI0ar0EvE
128,5-speed gearbox it was just a little bit,360.31,6.05,FmHI0ar0EvE
129,of muscle to get the shifts done,362.71,3.65,FmHI0ar0EvE
130,"get past 2,000 rpm and get ready for",367.11,5.7,FmHI0ar0EvE
131,that slug of God and it feels really,370.08,4.23,FmHI0ar0EvE
132,nice as you see the revenue to shoot,372.81,4.02,FmHI0ar0EvE
133,past 3000 rpm the other good thing is,374.31,5.43,FmHI0ar0EvE
134,that the revs don't just die out you can,376.83,5.73,FmHI0ar0EvE
135,actually use it to past four thousand to,379.74,4.2,FmHI0ar0EvE
136,about four and a half thousand rpm quite,382.56,4.05,FmHI0ar0EvE
137,nicely and that makes this quite a nice,383.94,9.93,FmHI0ar0EvE
138,engine for the highway the brezza in,386.61,10.97,FmHI0ar0EvE
139,fact boasts of a 5300 RPM rev limiter,393.87,6.599,FmHI0ar0EvE
140,that's quite high for a diesel car as,397.58,4.839,FmHI0ar0EvE
141,you spend more time behind the wheel of,400.469,4.5,FmHI0ar0EvE
142,the brezza one subtle sense tends to,402.419,5.271,FmHI0ar0EvE
143,grow on you,404.969,2.721,FmHI0ar0EvE
144,in some ways the vitara brezza feels,408.29,5.04,FmHI0ar0EvE
145,very European and that really shouldn't,410.66,5.01,FmHI0ar0EvE
146,come as a surprise because it is based,413.33,4.95,FmHI0ar0EvE
147,on a modified platform that's used on,415.67,3.9,FmHI0ar0EvE
148,the European Vdara,418.28,3.21,FmHI0ar0EvE
149,take the right quality for instance it,419.57,4.23,FmHI0ar0EvE
150,has a hint of firmness to it and in my,421.49,4.23,FmHI0ar0EvE
151,books on the whole it's not a bad thing,423.8,3.72,FmHI0ar0EvE
152,yeah you do feel a little bit of the,425.72,3.63,FmHI0ar0EvE
153,road surface creep into the cabin and,427.52,4.02,FmHI0ar0EvE
154,some bumps might come through but on the,429.35,3.87,FmHI0ar0EvE
155,world right quality is really quite,431.54,4.32,FmHI0ar0EvE
156,absorbent suspension work silently so,433.22,5.13,FmHI0ar0EvE
157,the cabin does CARICOM the good part,435.86,4.47,FmHI0ar0EvE
158,about the setup is that it gives you a,438.35,4.26,FmHI0ar0EvE
159,great sense of confidence when you're on,440.33,4.44,FmHI0ar0EvE
160,the highway in doing higher speeds for,442.61,4.5,FmHI0ar0EvE
161,longer distances it just makes the,444.77,8.19,FmHI0ar0EvE
162,driving experience more relaxed the high,447.11,8.31,FmHI0ar0EvE
163,speed stability is truly impressive,452.96,4.65,FmHI0ar0EvE
164,and as you motor along four kilometers,455.42,6.38,FmHI0ar0EvE
165,on end something else hits you,457.61,4.19,FmHI0ar0EvE
166,there's also the cabin refinement when,464.009,4.781,FmHI0ar0EvE
167,it comes to vibration it's really very,466.54,3.99,FmHI0ar0EvE
168,well damped even when you're lucky and,468.79,4.98,FmHI0ar0EvE
169,no speeds low engine RPMs you really,470.53,5.55,FmHI0ar0EvE
170,don't feel it inside the cabin the noise,473.77,4.17,FmHI0ar0EvE
171,from the motor is also very well,476.08,3.66,FmHI0ar0EvE
172,suppressed which can be really quite,477.94,5.46,FmHI0ar0EvE
173,audible in some other markets uzuki cars,479.74,7.75,FmHI0ar0EvE
174,on top of that wind noise road noise and,483.4,7.12,FmHI0ar0EvE
175,die noise are almost non-existent making,487.49,5.94,FmHI0ar0EvE
176,this a fairly calm cabin on the road you,490.52,4.709,FmHI0ar0EvE
177,realize that the seating position isn't,493.43,3.81,FmHI0ar0EvE
178,quite as high and commanding as you'd,495.229,3.78,FmHI0ar0EvE
179,like from something that's dubbed as an,497.24,4.709,FmHI0ar0EvE
180,SUV but a lower stance has its,499.009,6.24,FmHI0ar0EvE
181,advantages so what's the vitara brezza,501.949,5.4,FmHI0ar0EvE
182,like to drive when you're real in that,505.249,6.121,FmHI0ar0EvE
183,mood to drive but it's not particularly,507.349,5.791,FmHI0ar0EvE
184,exciting but it really doesn't do,511.37,3.93,FmHI0ar0EvE
185,anything wrong I love the steering for,513.14,4.41,FmHI0ar0EvE
186,instance is pretty direct but it just,515.3,8.19,FmHI0ar0EvE
187,doesn't feel Christmas wait turns in the,517.55,8.37,FmHI0ar0EvE
188,corners is quite planted it feels solid,523.49,6.27,FmHI0ar0EvE
189,but again it's not as quick and as sharp,525.92,6.359,FmHI0ar0EvE
190,as you'd want it to be to really hit,529.76,5.43,FmHI0ar0EvE
191,that sweet spot but I know all I'm going,532.279,4.861,FmHI0ar0EvE
192,to say it feels safe and planted and,535.19,7.589,FmHI0ar0EvE
193,that should do for most people a lot of,537.14,7.71,FmHI0ar0EvE
194,its composure is also down to the wider,542.779,6.75,FmHI0ar0EvE
195,and grippy 215 by 60 r16 Apolo tires,544.85,7.169,FmHI0ar0EvE
196,that are offered on the top and zti,549.529,3.851,FmHI0ar0EvE
197,variant,552.019,4.451,FmHI0ar0EvE

199,hit the sweet spot with the vitara,556.47,7.44,FmHI0ar0EvE
200,brezza one thing is pretty clear Maruti,558.27,7.65,FmHI0ar0EvE
201,Suzuki is new with ara Brezza isn't,563.91,3.36,FmHI0ar0EvE
202,going to target your heartstrings the,565.92,4.02,FmHI0ar0EvE
203,way the has and does even today,567.27,5.76,FmHI0ar0EvE
204,but just because it's unexcited and,569.94,5.49,FmHI0ar0EvE
205,little understated do not let it drop,573.03,4.29,FmHI0ar0EvE
206,off your radar if you're in the market,575.43,4.35,FmHI0ar0EvE
207,for a compact SUV because underneath is,577.32,5.07,FmHI0ar0EvE
208,a really solid and sensible package when,579.78,4.02,FmHI0ar0EvE
209,you round up the kind of performance,582.39,4.08,FmHI0ar0EvE
210,drivability that comfort the sense of,583.8,5.28,FmHI0ar0EvE
211,space and the features that this car,586.47,5.22,FmHI0ar0EvE

213,solid well rounded package and then,591.69,3.87,FmHI0ar0EvE
214,factor in the price that is being,594.36,3.42,FmHI0ar0EvE

19,a thick chrome bar on the grille that,60.39,4.44,T8D8nQBcl8I
20,connects the two headlights the fog-like,62.37,4.92,T8D8nQBcl8I
21,enclosures are much larger and looked,64.83,4.92,T8D8nQBcl8I
22,like mini inlets and there's a tougher,67.29,5.759,T8D8nQBcl8I
23,looking new bull bar must say I think it,69.75,6.6,T8D8nQBcl8I
24,works well not much has changed at the,73.049,5.281,T8D8nQBcl8I
25,rear but the new LED surrounds on the,76.35,6.18,T8D8nQBcl8I
26,taillights work well too now let's get,78.33,7.53,T8D8nQBcl8I
27,going well first up what's clear is that,82.53,7.409,T8D8nQBcl8I
28,the ride is more comfortable now right,85.86,8.009,T8D8nQBcl8I
29,away on these broken roads and all these,89.939,7.68,T8D8nQBcl8I
30,bumps you can easily tell that ride is,93.869,6.36,T8D8nQBcl8I
31,much improved it's much softer it's more,97.619,5.521,T8D8nQBcl8I
32,supple there's no hard edge like there,100.229,5.43,T8D8nQBcl8I
33,was earlier and even when you go over,103.14,5.22,T8D8nQBcl8I
34,some seriously big stuff like these,105.659,5.82,T8D8nQBcl8I
35,bumps it doesn't even cut through so a,108.36,6.13,T8D8nQBcl8I
36,lot of comfort and,111.479,8.291,T8D8nQBcl8I
37,a much more supple ride what also sets,114.49,8.79,T8D8nQBcl8I
38,the bracer part is the robust build and,119.77,5.79,T8D8nQBcl8I
39,that's the other thing about this guy,123.28,5.61,T8D8nQBcl8I
40,it's always had a tough suspension it's,125.56,6.0,T8D8nQBcl8I
41,always been pretty robust and it feels,128.89,5.34,T8D8nQBcl8I
42,like you can chuck this car into just,131.56,6.149,T8D8nQBcl8I
43,about any ditch or hole and not have to,134.23,6.6,T8D8nQBcl8I
44,worry about it and that's fabulous,137.709,5.371,T8D8nQBcl8I
45,also different on this bezu is the,140.83,4.56,T8D8nQBcl8I
46,steering setup as much lighter it's much,143.08,3.42,T8D8nQBcl8I
47,easier to twirl,145.39,3.179,T8D8nQBcl8I
48,there's less weight and that makes it,146.5,5.43,T8D8nQBcl8I
49,more practical for everyday use the,148.569,5.67,T8D8nQBcl8I
50,downside of that however is that it,151.93,5.73,T8D8nQBcl8I
51,isn't very nice in corners it's quite,154.239,6.681,T8D8nQBcl8I
52,vague there isn't too much feel and,157.66,5.909,T8D8nQBcl8I
53,probably because the heavy weight of the,160.92,4.26,T8D8nQBcl8I
54,diesel has come off the front wheels,163.569,6.48,T8D8nQBcl8I
55,there's much less Road feel the petrol,165.18,8.41,T8D8nQBcl8I
56,engine however is quite refined now,170.049,5.581,T8D8nQBcl8I
57,because this is a naturally aspirated,173.59,4.95,T8D8nQBcl8I
58,engine the bottom end is nice and smooth,175.63,6.109,T8D8nQBcl8I
59,progression is good and it does pull,178.54,9.93,T8D8nQBcl8I
60,pretty cleanly what you do miss over is,181.739,9.101,T8D8nQBcl8I
61,that spike of power around two or three,188.47,7.41,T8D8nQBcl8I
62,thousand rpm this engine just feels flat,190.84,7.649,T8D8nQBcl8I
63,and doesn't have the mid-range punch you,195.88,5.699,T8D8nQBcl8I
64,expect from a diesel or a turbo petrol,198.489,5.551,T8D8nQBcl8I
65,spin the engine faster and things,201.579,6.301,T8D8nQBcl8I
66,however improve now you get past around,204.04,7.44,T8D8nQBcl8I
67,"3,000 rpm and this naturally aspirated",207.88,6.63,T8D8nQBcl8I
68,engine comes into its own it pulls all,211.48,6.03,T8D8nQBcl8I
69,"the way to around 6,000 cleanly and then",214.51,6.36,T8D8nQBcl8I
70,shift up and it carries on and then,217.51,8.129,T8D8nQBcl8I
71,performance is pretty strong it's,220.87,7.8,T8D8nQBcl8I
72,reasonably quick 0 to 100 coming up in,225.639,6.66,T8D8nQBcl8I
73,11.8 seconds and that even compares well,228.67,6.39,T8D8nQBcl8I
74,with the venue turbo petrol and what's,232.299,6.0,T8D8nQBcl8I
75,also nice is this clutch and gearbox,235.06,6.299,T8D8nQBcl8I
76,como it's nice and light the clutch it,238.299,6.231,T8D8nQBcl8I
77,engages easily and doesn't pop,241.359,5.96,T8D8nQBcl8I
78,and the gearbox is absolutely beautiful,244.53,6.5,T8D8nQBcl8I
79,light direct and an absolute joy to use,247.319,7.471,T8D8nQBcl8I
80,it almost makes you want to forget the,251.03,9.269,T8D8nQBcl8I
81,automatic ah the automatic that's next,254.79,5.509,T8D8nQBcl8I
82,now the brezza also gets an automatic,260.51,6.67,T8D8nQBcl8I
83,not the same AMT as the earlier diesel,263.76,6.72,T8D8nQBcl8I
84,brezza this one is the 4-speed torque,267.18,5.97,T8D8nQBcl8I
85,converter equipped Auto the same as on,270.48,6.21,T8D8nQBcl8I
86,the ethica with the 1.5 this engine this,273.15,6.96,T8D8nQBcl8I
87,one is also nice and smooth easy to,276.69,7.43,T8D8nQBcl8I
88,drive and has a nice strong bottom end,280.11,7.5,T8D8nQBcl8I
89,that torque converter gives this engine,284.12,6.04,T8D8nQBcl8I
90,a nice stock fill at the bottom and,287.61,5.67,T8D8nQBcl8I
91,gives it some muscle and that means you,290.16,5.7,T8D8nQBcl8I
92,can take off smartly from rest and you,293.28,5.07,T8D8nQBcl8I
93,have a reasonable amount of power when,295.86,4.89,T8D8nQBcl8I
94,you need to get back on the throttle get,298.35,4.379,T8D8nQBcl8I
95,to an open road however and because it,300.75,5.25,T8D8nQBcl8I
96,has only four speeds is a bit of stretch,302.729,7.231,T8D8nQBcl8I
97,and strain and the gap between the,306.0,7.05,T8D8nQBcl8I
98,ratios is so large that you feel you've,309.96,6.68,T8D8nQBcl8I
99,sometimes fallen out of the power band,313.05,6.179,T8D8nQBcl8I
100,acceleration isn't as strong as a manual,316.64,6.1,T8D8nQBcl8I
101,it takes 13.4 seconds from zero to 100,319.229,6.421,T8D8nQBcl8I
102,no real changes on the inside however,322.74,5.22,T8D8nQBcl8I
103,yes you do get this new smart play here,325.65,5.1,T8D8nQBcl8I
104,and you interface for marthy and you,327.96,4.95,T8D8nQBcl8I
105,also get a small number of differences,330.75,4.8,T8D8nQBcl8I
106,because it's the automatic and it's a,332.91,5.73,T8D8nQBcl8I
107,mild hybrid little things like this tiny,335.55,5.28,T8D8nQBcl8I
108,display here where chose the engine the,338.64,4.29,T8D8nQBcl8I
109,electric motor and the battery to tell,340.83,4.11,T8D8nQBcl8I
110,you about how the hybrid system is,342.93,4.32,T8D8nQBcl8I
111,functioning and there's a start/stop,344.94,4.92,T8D8nQBcl8I
112,button here on the left as well as these,347.25,6.419,T8D8nQBcl8I
113,automatically folding mirrors but apart,349.86,6.15,T8D8nQBcl8I
114,from that the interiors are just the,353.669,5.671,T8D8nQBcl8I
115,same a bit too plasticky and grain the,356.01,5.46,T8D8nQBcl8I
116,rear seat however is still a nice place,359.34,4.8,T8D8nQBcl8I
117,to be now one big strength the brezza,361.47,4.58,T8D8nQBcl8I
118,has is that it's nice and wide and,364.14,4.38,T8D8nQBcl8I
119,comfortable in the back bit of theater,366.05,4.54,T8D8nQBcl8I
120,seating here you sit at a good height,368.52,3.899,T8D8nQBcl8I
121,above the front seats so you can look,370.59,5.96,T8D8nQBcl8I
122,out enough Headroom and shoulder room,372.419,6.831,T8D8nQBcl8I
123,the seat is pretty good also and the,376.55,4.74,T8D8nQBcl8I
124,decent amount of legroom there's no vent,379.25,4.65,T8D8nQBcl8I
125,here for the backseat passengers and no,381.29,5.1,T8D8nQBcl8I
126,charging points but if you want to be,383.9,4.98,T8D8nQBcl8I
127,chauffeur driven this probably is one of,386.39,6.32,T8D8nQBcl8I
128,the best cars in its class to do it in,388.88,6.57,T8D8nQBcl8I
129,the press our Patrol isn't the best,392.71,5.95,T8D8nQBcl8I
130,equipped SUV in is classed still top ZXI,395.45,5.88,T8D8nQBcl8I
131,and ZXI plus versions get kit like auto,398.66,5.4,T8D8nQBcl8I
132,headlights rain sensing wipers LED,401.33,6.06,T8D8nQBcl8I
133,headlights etc stuff missing includes,404.06,5.91,T8D8nQBcl8I
134,wireless charging electronic stability,407.39,6.27,T8D8nQBcl8I
135,control sunroof and it's not a connected,409.97,8.21,T8D8nQBcl8I
136,car even today in 2020,413.66,4.52,T8D8nQBcl8I
137,[Music],418.84,3.65,T8D8nQBcl8I
138,[Music],425.73,8.32,T8D8nQBcl8I
139,cosmetic changes on the outside have no,431.49,4.69,T8D8nQBcl8I
140,doubt refresh the brezza which now looks,434.05,4.17,T8D8nQBcl8I
141,distinctive and different from the,436.18,3.87,T8D8nQBcl8I
142,earlier one the talking point of course,438.22,3.87,T8D8nQBcl8I
143,is the switch to Patrol the biggest,440.05,4.55,T8D8nQBcl8I
144,benefit of which is smooth running and,442.09,5.84,T8D8nQBcl8I
145,refinement but that's what you expect,444.6,5.2,T8D8nQBcl8I
146,performance with a hundred and five,447.93,4.15,T8D8nQBcl8I
147,horsepower on tap is also marginally,449.8,4.47,T8D8nQBcl8I
148,stronger especially at high engine,452.08,5.25,T8D8nQBcl8I
149,speeds but what you do miss a lot is,454.27,5.79,T8D8nQBcl8I
150,that mid-range punch that both a turbo,457.33,5.34,T8D8nQBcl8I
151,diesel and even a turbo petrol would,460.06,5.16,T8D8nQBcl8I
152,deliver in truth though the engine is,462.67,4.98,T8D8nQBcl8I
153,the largest in its class performance,465.22,5.34,T8D8nQBcl8I
154,isn't exactly scintillating on the flip,467.65,5.22,T8D8nQBcl8I
155,side the disadvantage of all that extra,470.56,4.44,T8D8nQBcl8I
156,engine displacement is that the brezza,472.87,5.88,T8D8nQBcl8I
157,loses its small car tax benefit which is,475.0,7.05,T8D8nQBcl8I
158,why with prices ranging from 7.4 lakhs,478.75,5.19,T8D8nQBcl8I
159,to 11 point 4 lakhs,482.05,4.41,T8D8nQBcl8I
160,it isn't as comparatively priced as its,483.94,5.76,T8D8nQBcl8I
161,rivals and that apart it isn't as well,486.46,6.6,T8D8nQBcl8I
162,equipped either even the cabin is barely,489.7,6.24,T8D8nQBcl8I
163,changed still Maruti has played to the,493.06,4.77,T8D8nQBcl8I
164,brezza strengths of practicality,495.94,4.979,T8D8nQBcl8I
165,ease-of-use and overall dependability,497.83,5.339,T8D8nQBcl8I
166,and that's what marathi will be banking,500.919,7.371,T8D8nQBcl8I
167,on to keep its share of SUV buyers,503.169,5.121,T8D8nQBcl8I
168,[Music],510.23,6.7,T8D8nQBcl8I
169,[Laughter],512.74,6.25,T8D8nQBcl8I
170,you,516.93,2.06,T8D8nQBcl8I
