0,0,HE9YtNnvbSs,[Music] a year ago we tested the tata outros and it really impressed us with its space its ride and handling and of course its looks but what really didn't impress us too much was its petrol engine we thought it was underpowered and rather unrefined too however tata are now making amends with this [Music] yes this is the turbocharged version of that same motor now tata promises that it's transformed the driving experience and i'm really keen to find out if they've succeeded [Music] so i'm going to be focused on the engine and its performance the rest of the car is pretty similar to the regular altras but if you do want to have a look at that in detail then we have the video up on our youtube channel and of course don't forget to subscribe and hit the bell icon and you'll be notified every time we post a new video now with the turbos trapped on there's been a noteworthy bump in power from 86 horsepower to 110 torque 2 has climbed from 113 newton meters to 140. this is still lower than what the engine makes in the nexon however and that's because the altros's 5-speed gearbox would also need to change to handle the extra power the rated efficiency has dropped from 19.05 kpl to 18.13 not much a word of caution though in the real world turbo petrols can be thirsty now is it an improvement over the regular naturally aspirated petrol the short answer is yes there is certainly more power and the car no longer feels like it's dragging anchor and it's easy enough to keep up with traffic demand any more however and it will leave you wanting the trouble is that while performance is an improvement it's nowhere near the others like the polo 1.0 tsi that has a sub 10 second time in the zero to 100 kilometer per hour dash the altros claims a time of under 12 seconds while we only manage 12.68 in a quick test and this was in sport mode yes that's right the ultros eye turbo has a sport mode [Music] the regular petrol has a eco and a city mode this one has a city and a sport the sport mode isn't peppy though and it misses that punchy feel the thing is though the power comes in at around 1800 rpm and rather sedately so you press down like this and then it'll build up slow all the way and then at around about 4800 rpm it will catch like a second wind and it's certainly fun and entertaining but i would have preferred it if it were at a lower rev the engine is vibration free however refinement isn't great and it does sound coarse there's also some road noise from the front and on the whole the nvh levels could do with some improvement the altros's chassis setup of course is just fine ride is superb as is the handling we've really liked it in the car before and it remains the same here tata say they have made small tweaks to the suspension and steering and expectedly ride and handling is excellent the well judged suspension along with the stiff and taut body shell enable the car to sail over even sharp ruts and potholes with ease the steering is nice and light at low city speeds and then at higher speeds into corners it weighs up really nicely giving you a good amount of confidence and with the chassis setup the altros really has the potential to be a good driver's car [Applause] with the turbo altrus tata has also introduced its ira smart connected tech a new color the one we have on test and there's also new perforated leatherette seats there's also a new black and light gray interior that looks very nice and a few extra features like two more tweeters on the sweet sounding harman system so the altro's has a decent amount of kit it looks good it's got ample space and the ride and handling is superb there's also the five star crash rating to boot and tata may also play the value card and price it competitively the addition of the turbo though hasn't transformed the car into the hot hatch we expected what it has done however is it's brought the performance more in line with the car sporty character and has now nicely rounded off a well-packaged car you,0.10000000149011612,1.2000000476837158
1,1,P3zzRrKjxVI,[Music] so finally something that's not hen SUV we have a hatchback to test and a very important one at that this is the Hyundai grand i10 Neos which is the successor to the very popular grand i10 now the grand i10 isn't gonna go anywhere soon this car is going to be selling alongside the grand i10 but obviously it's bigger it's more spacious better equip and crucially it's a segment higher and pitted directly against the Swift in fact the Swift's jugular is what Hyundai is going for it's got a petrol option and a diesel option like before but crucially you've got AMT versions automatic versions for both and now we've got both these cars here in their pool to tell you what they're about [Music] but before I Drive off let's have a closer look at what's new and if the Neos which means more lives up to its name for starters it's wider and longer than the grand i10 and looks more grown-up two gone is the two-part grille and what you get is a massive single grille which you can't miss and quite frankly it looks a touch too big what looks really cool are those boomerang shaped DRL tucked away at the edge of the grille and top variants also get projector lights the sides get sharper creases in the bodywork and the 15-inch diamond cut alloys look terrific another well-executed detail is the textured blacked-out section in the c-pillar with G Iten embossed on one side move to the rear and you'll notice the hyundai h has gotten bigger and you will find a shark fin antenna on the roof and there's even a chrome strip at the base of the tailgate the tail lamps however are still a touch small so for sure the Neos looks good but what's it like to drive [Music] now I've started out in the 1.2 patrol manual and this variant is gonna form the bulk of nior sales just like it was with the grand i10 in fact this is the same engine and transmission from the grand i10 the only difference is that this one is bs6 compliant it meets the latest emission regulations now and typically that comes with a penalty of fuel consumption but in this car this is actually one kpl more fuel efficient and that's because it's lighter it's 30 to 40 kilos lighter because they're using more tensile steel in this high tensile strength steel which is lighter and stronger and also the engine has been more finely tuned the ECU has been more finely tuned so Hyundai has managed to actually give even better fuel efficiency on the test cycle but has to move to be s6 impacted performance now this one point to petrol it's great in the city it's quite responsive it's good on path throttle you can just amble along you really don't feel it's underpowered it keeps up with the traffic so as a city car it does quite well but the minute you get on the highway and you want more out of it you are greeted by what is a very gutless pot of men there's just absolutely nothing lowdown in the revs you have to rev the hell out of this engine wring its neck to get the most out of it so really on the highway you will be pushing this engin quite a bit and quite frankly it doesn't have the zing of the suzuki k-series which you get at the Swift and now to check out how it handles now with the stiffer chassis you can soften the suspension of bitter without having an impact on body control and the nias has a slightly softer setup over the grand i10 it's a little bit more pliant it's a little bit more plush but you still get a little bit of vertical movement over these undulations on this road it's it's fairly planted it's quite secure you can cruise happily at three digit speeds just that the steering isn't super accurate you have to make small Corrections while going through these sweepers over here again this car isn't made for the highway it's been tuned for the city where the light steering is a boon but if you are taking it out of town it's a car that's it's quite comfortable at speeds as well quite clearly this is a car that's designed to be a happy city commuter and not one that encourages spirited driving so is the diesel Neos any different I flipped into the MT variant to see what it's like you get an automatic option for both the petrol and diesel engines and right now I am in the diesel automatic what's interesting is that the diesel and the petrol both come with a MTS and not the torque converter of the grand i10 now in terms of hierarchy a torque converter is normally superior it's smoother EMTs are considered the poor man's automatic but quite frankly for our conditions EMTs are making more sense firstly because they're far more fuel efficient in fact one of the reasons why the grand i10 auto wasn't popular is because it doesn't fuel the other thing also is that there is a big cost advantage the only real downside is and that's the biggest downside is just the way the power is delivered AMT is not typically as smooth as the conventional torque converters you do get a bit of that head nod or that interruption in power and on this version Hyundai has improved it quite a bit we thought first on the Santro but it's really been improved further after that now driving into they proved that pause between gear shifts doesn't really bother you too much EMTs have come a long way and Hyun dies AMT is particularly good it's only when you're going from first to second at the head not is most pronounced this three cylinder diesel engine developed seventy-five horsepower like before and isn't the most refined with that noticeable throm at idle it's reasonably punchy but again runs out of steam on the highway but surprisingly the diesel variant felt better than the petrol Neos on these monsoon ravaged roads I was quite surprised by the pounding this car could take now on rough roads I prefer the diesel basically for two reasons because firstly to accommodate the heavier diesel engine the front suspension has been beefed up which is good and the other reason is that on this AMT variant which doesn't come in a top spec you get a smaller 14-inch wheel and with that is a tire with a higher profile or a taller sidewall and that really cushions you against the shocks and just how well does the cabin pamper you I'm back in the top spec petrol to see how comfortable and well-equipped it is so I'm inside the grand i10 Neos and like most human dry cabins this is a nice place to be it's quite a refreshing design in here firstly is the choice of colors you've got this grey and white kind of theme even from the seats even to the dashboard you've got some interesting texture over here a bit of a design elements I love the the rotary vents over here they have a nice quality feel to it the instrumentation again quite unique you've got an analogue tach and a digital speedo over all plastics I have to say are not absolutely brilliant in fact I dare say the Santhosh plastics in certain areas feel better but let's not forget that this isn't a premium hatch it's a mid hatch so obviously some things are going to be dumbed down even in terms of equipment you've not got all the toys but you have got which is a first in class wireless charging the 8 inch touchscreen is the largest in class and placed high it's easy to operate and yes apple carplay and android auto is there overall the Neos doesn't fare too badly on the equipment front but does miss out on things like auto headlamps and rain sensing wipers which rivals offer [Music] [Music] let's check out the backseat now the sense of space in the backseat well it's it's really really good and that's not just because the legroom is impressive or the Headroom is very generous even for tall people but the light colors inside which gives a sense of airiness the seat also good under thigh support and the base is canted up so that also helps you've got rear aircon vents but overall the seat is quite flat it is actually a bench there's no armrests there are no proper contours so it doesn't really hold you in but clearly this has been designed for three people let's not forget that this is a family hatch and you and I want to pack in as many people as it can and actually if you compare this to the grand i10 and even the competition there's far more space in the new neos it's a practical cabin tube with generous door pockets a decent-sized glovebox which has a very useful shelf above it the 260 litre boot is marginally bigger than before but not as big as the Swift's the back seat flips down but the release straps are a bit fiddly to use so then to sum up should you buy an EOS is it that much better than the grand i10 and is it a better alternative to the Swift well it doesn't quite have the Swift's individualistic appeal and nor is it as much fun to drive but to live with the Neos with its easy driving manners comfortable and practical cabin comes out on top this new grand i10 is more of an evolution than a revolution but it has a well-rounded versatility that makes it much more of a complete package now [Music] [Laughter],0.30000001192092896,3.0999999046325684
2,2,PI2AfIKdcZg,[Music] don't underestimate this feeling's too contagious [Music] [Applause] this is the all-new xuv700 and yes mahendra have a lot riding on this one because after the success of the thar they really need this one to do as much or more to state to the world that they are indeed an suv manufacturer to be reckoned with the xuv700 promises a lot with both petrol and diesel powertrains available in manual and automatic options and an all-wheel drive variant as well as a feature list that is enviable it has all the arsenal to take on the competition can it shake up the segment that's what we're going to find out now if you'd rather watch the review in hindi head to our sister channel what car india and you can watch the full review of the xuv700 in hindi as well now i've been chatting away with you guys comfortably because the xuv700 has been doing a lot of the work for me so yes the xuv700 offers eight ass features like adaptive cruise control autonomous emergency brakes forward collision warning lane departure warning lane keep assist smart pilot and high beam assist at autocar we really believe in active safety and these advanced driver assistance systems which is what ada stands for are what help you prevent a crash while we have seen adas before it is a standout feature for the xuv700 because this is a segment first so the adaptive cruise control works really well all you need to do is press cruise control set your desired speed and then you can set the distance to the car in front of you and it's a three-step setting that you can have either in close far or really like a safe mode i've got it in its closest setting and then take your feet off the pedals and let the car do all the work for you all you have to do is just steer the car along and it will do the rest of the work now on the cornering you can see that the system takes it a little slower it doesn't actually keep quite up with the car in front it takes the corner at a speed that's safe for the car now if the car in front of you slows down suddenly and then starts off again the system works just fine to slow you down and start you off again if the car in front decides to come to a complete halt this will do the same and then start off again as well so yeah um it works really well my feet are firmly planted on the floor haven't touched the brakes haven't touched the accelerator i'm just driving along comfortably keeping pace with the car in front and should a biker or a pedestrian cross your path unexpectedly the emergency brakes will kick in and when your lane keep assist is on you can even really take your hands off the steering wheel for a bit because the car will keep to the lane for you once there are clear lane markings around if you're veering off your lane the lane departure warning will gently tug at your steering wheel to warn you as well as give you an alarm the intensity of the warnings can be preset as well the reaction time of the system may differ from yours and so it takes a little getting used to but once you do you will find it all works really well in fact so well that you might be tempted to take your hands off the wheel completely and take a nap but remember to always keep your hands on the wheel and eyes on the road there's nothing like human instinct there are additional safety features like the personalized safety alert that records the voice of a loved one warning you when you're over speeding there's a lane watch camera that kicks in when you use the indicators and shows you something that's too close behind you or in a blind spot there's also a 360 degree camera that can be accessed on the go and has multiple view settings to see every possible angle around the car so yeah mahindra said safety is a core pillar of the xuv700 and it sure looks like it let's take a look at all the safety features well i'm sure you want to know all about the other exciting features that the xuv700 comes with and i will be telling you in detail later on the story so stay tuned to the whole story right to the end to know all about them but for now let's talk about the engines the xuv700 is powered by a 2.2 liter turbo diesel with two power iterations a 155 hp with 360 nm of torque or a class leading 185 hp with 420 nm of torque on the manual and 450 nm of torque on the auto there is also the most powerful iteration of mahindra's m stallion 2 liter turbo petrol that produces a very strong 200 hp and 380 nm of torque making it the most powerful in its segment they both come with a six-speed manual and a six-speed torque converter automatic and as i've said before for those who believe that an suv is incomplete without off-road hardware you will get the option of all-wheel drive now i've kicked it off with the petrol automatic which is going to be a popular choice because this is a creamy smooth engine that really brings a smile to your face now it's not a punchy shove of torque that you get when the turbo kicks in but it's more of a very solid strong linear acceleration and it's quick so it's really delightful a preliminary test at the track gave us a 0-100 time of 9.32 seconds and that makes it the fastest in its class this is a cracker of an engine power kicks in around 1800 rpm after which you ride a big giant wave now today it's a test track and the delightful part is i have no speed limit so yeah uh 142 45 47 48 49 50 51 it just keeps going and the way this gets to alarming numbers of triple digit speeds is just fantastic it does it so easily this engine really breathes easy and while flying around this high speed track over here i mean i'm doing around 160 i'm on the banking and i can keep going grip is amazing body control is amazing roll is well contained and even the steering wheel is giving me an amazing amount of confidence so really the dynamics are good enough to keep up with the power that this engine has but coming back to the performance there's a joy in knowing that whenever you want power it will be served up even at higher speeds put your foot down and it's always ready to give you some more so overtakes on the highway will come very easy now as good as this feels out on the highway it's as tractable in city driving conditions which we're simulating with a car driving in front of me now it's crawling along at low speeds stopping starting and simulating basically what driving in traffic would be like and i have to say it is really a breeze this makes very light work of driving in congested conditions the steering is light and easy so nipping in and out of traffic gaps is going to be simple taking u-turns will be pretty easy as well and so will parking be and when you want to park you do have that 360 degree camera as well to help you with visibility all around a lot of the ease of the driving comes from the ice and source six-speak torque converter automatic that seems to always be in sync with your driving needs and when you want a sudden burst of power for an overtake the downshifts come quick enough and even the up shifts are so progressive and smooth while driving on the winding section of road i didn't feel the need to use the manual mode the engine and gearbox work so well in tandem to ensure that it's a fun drive there are no paddles on the xuv but honestly so far i haven't missed them on a winding section of road body control is good roll is well contained and the steering weighs up quite nicely overall dynamic capability has taken a huge leap forward and a lot of it has to do with the torsional stiffness of the new chassis which is 80 better than before giving the car a great base to build on it feels like it's built tough now from one auto to the other i'm driving the diesel auto now which is going to be another favorite i have to say the engine here too is pretty refined and smooth and it's only when you push it hard then you realize it's a diesel the order box works well here too but it doesn't really mask the lag so you know at particularly low speeds when you slow down and you know like you would be doing in a city and you want a sudden burst of power to start up again you might have to wait that little moment but having said that this engine and gearbox combination is probably one of the best in the segment i'd go as far as saying that it does feel quick the engine is another really good offering from eminem and belts out power strongly and our test on the mahindra track we hit the 100 mark in 10.34 seconds making it another really quick powertrain now the key difference between the diesel and the petrol is that in the diesel you get drive modes and the drive modes are called zip zap and zoom zip is obviously for economy and that uses only 155 hp when you shift to zap you unleash the full 185 hp and you can feel the difference almost instantly and zoom well that really brings a smile to your face the throttle responses get much quicker and it feels fun to drive you also have a custom mode with the choice of modes whether you're crawling in city traffic or on a highway power is served up when you need it it does feel a little nose heavy compared to the petrol and so it's not quite as agile but it still feels solid secure planted cornering feels very good as well and you get a very nice connected feel to the road but the steering is heavier than it is in the petrol while it does feel a little more weighted than the petrol it is still light enough for city maneuvers and parking the two manual variants are being driven by surges out in the real world so it's over to him now so while renuka has been driving the automatics on the track i'm here with the manuals out on the highway out in the real world and it's given us a small little chance to feel what they feel like out on our regular roads i've wit of course the diesel manual and this would be my pick between the two diesels the gearbox does let you use the power much more effectively and in the auto that little bit of lag that you feel you can just drive around it with manual control the gear shifts are not the smoothest but it's not a big complaint either what's amazing is of course that refinement from the engine another bit i was keen to experience out here was the ride and it's a massive improvement over the xuv500 it isn't class leading and doesn't quite flatten the surface but the ride is well composed and you don't get tossed around on bad roads highway ride 2 is well composed and you can confidently carry high digit speeds over even less than perfect surfaces and now it's over to the one for the petrol heads the petrol manual so we are with the petrol manual now this powertrain combination forms the entry point to the xuv700 series having driven it though i can tell you that the performance is anything but entry level it's an absolute firecracker of a unit the 200 horsepower delivers tons of performance and the best bit with the manual gearbox yes of course you do miss the convenience of an auto but you can now rev it to its 5800 rpm limit and that is really something that i'm sure a lot of driving enthusiasts would enjoy now with the driving done it's time for me to hop into the back seat backseat space was one of the strengths of the xuv500 earlier when it was launched but it's been a long time since and there now larger cars the safari the hector they all have a lot of back seat space however this one is bigger too there's more space between the wheels and it may not be class leading but it still is a very spacious back seat to tall people will be extremely comfortable one behind the other and if you're on the passenger side you even have this lever to move the seat all the way in front get really comfy stretch your legs and even recline the seat so yeah there is ample space and you can get very comfortable then you have that panoramic sunroof that really makes it feel very airy you sit high up and visibility to the front is good too [Music] as for the ride quality you heard sergis is verdict out in the real world and the xuv700 uses frequency selective dampers and stabilizer bars front and rear to give it the composure although the engineers at m m have done a great job of the ride and handling capability of the xuv700 which is a huge leap forward from the xuv500 it doesn't quite have the finesse of some of its rivals now as far as features go for the rear seat passengers they get air-con vents a usb-c port and an arm rest with cupholders now with the arm rest up three abreast will be comfortable here but why believe me let me show you now while the boys are going to check out the middle row i'm going to check out the third row back to the petrol [Music] the width remains the same as the previous xuv500 and it seats three adults quite easily the central console does intrude into the rear a bit but there is still enough legroom for the third passenger now getting into the third row is from the passenger side because it has that single flip and full seat that makes it easy and it's not so difficult for someone my size ingress is pretty easy there is no recline for the backrest so yeah you do sit a bit upright you do sit a bit knees up and this is best for small kids however you do have an ac vent for yourself you have a 12 volt charging port and you do have cup holders as well back here we also found later that the rear seat does recline but the lever is the one at the back of the seat used to flip it down so it's hard to find and difficult to access so that's about the third row what i have to do tell you as well is that the middle row is pretty easy even elderly people won't find it too high to get into because it is pretty much at hip level it's not much of a step up and the door opens quite wide as well so getting in and out is pretty easy now while i go and check out the front you guys go and check out the boot with three rows up boot volume is still marginal but it does seem a little more than before and of course you can flip and fold the seats down to open up way more room [Music] well it is a fresh looking spanking new interior here on the xuv700 and taking center stage of course is this single piece glass screen which houses the infotainment and the digital dial cluster both of them are 10.25 inch sharp graphics and a host of functions and we'll get to those in a bit but for now let me show you around the interior the dash is very neatly laid out there's a leather finish across the middle you get a chrome look plastic plastics are nice and they look good as well so yeah finishing and quality of materials looks good there is piano black in the center there are toggle switches over here for easy access to functions uh your hvac controls sit on dials and knobs over here and i quite like that actually the central console has two cup holders what is really nice over here is that you have a wireless charging pad which is easy access over here but you have another extra slot for a phone as well over there and you get usb ports as well for charging you have a rotary dial which lets you access the functions on your infotainment screen as well storage space over here which is quite nice and deep and a nifty handy little tray in the storage space the door pockets can house one liter bottles as well so yeah it seems to be a really practical interior what's new as well here are the seat functions very similar to the mercedes as well there's memory and powered seat functions for the driver side the lumbar support however is manual via a dial on the side of the seat on the ergonomic front while most of it is okay the door unlock button is quite a ways back on the door handle making it a little awkward to access some of the things on the interior that let it down a bit are the piano black finish which is not quite as good as the rivals and the wood look on the doors which stands out as low rent in contrast to the rest the digital cluster has three themes you can choose from and is crisp and clear [Music] now while it does let you access a wide variety of driver focus functions and trip information getting in and out of the menus is a bit cumbersome one has to toggle through the menus by a button on the steering wheel and press to access but when you want to revert to the original menu it just isn't a back button that you have to press you have to run through the menu go up to exit and then it doesn't automatically refer to the last info screen you had you would have to re-access it by another set of toggles there is a favorite button to help you get back to a certain menu but that would mean remembering to set a favorite every time you accessed a new menu just so that you could get back to the original one the system could be a whole lot simpler the infotainment screen is also slick and responds well to touch you have a cool 360 degree camera which i spoke to you about earlier and you also have apple carplay and android auto to access functions other than the screen one can either swipe up for all the apps or down for the shortcuts you also get alexa which can access features even without connectivity alexa can you open the sunroof of course when connected you can ask alexa anything from directions to a recipe and she would serve that up too there are also some interesting functions like a geforce meter and a lap time recorder under the fun with xuv tab now the infotainment system was in a beta testing stage so we will reserve comment on its functionality for a later time when we see the final version there is also a 445 watt 12 speaker sony sound system including subwoofers it has 3d sound with building blocks technology and digital sound enhancement as well and it gives you a variety of sound settings to suit your hearing needs there are a couple of features that the xuv misses on like ventilated seats and paddle shifts and an auto dimming rear view but the segment first features here outweigh all of that and overall the interior with its extensive equipment list does have a lot of wow factor now while the higher draenox variants get the large twin 10.25 inch screens the lower mx variants will get an eight inch screen and a seven inch cluster now at this time mahindra have given us the feature list on four variants so let's take a look at those [Music] finally let's talk about the way the xuv700 looks let's begin with a spanking new logo nestled in the center of the double slatted grille that fans outwards where its lines meet the twin drls the fang like headlamps are a trademark now and extend to the bumper that houses the fogs encased in black cladding and the air dam the bonnet retains the xuv flared sides but they are a little softer now the profile is also very familiar and a lot like the outgoing xuv500 but there are the new flush door handles while the top end variants will pop out as you approach the car the mid versions will require to push and then pull open but the base version will require you to use the key unlock push to pop out and pull to open now some people may really like these handles but personally i'm not a fan the top variants get 18-inch alloys while the lower variants get 17-inch steel wheels the rear looks quite nice especially the chisel line that sits between the tail lamps that extend down and over the sides there is a matte silver fake diffuser at the lower end and a spoiler on the top dimension wise the xuv500 has grown overall in length and there is also more space between the wheels but the height is lower and the width remains the same ground clearance seems to be on par with its rivals which should be around 200 millimeters this may not turn heads but is definitely a more mature design so why is it called the xuv700 if it's replacing the xuv500 well mostly because it's all new and mahindra didn't want people to think it was just an evolution but also because mahindra are leaving space for a bit size suv to come a little later and take that moniker and mahindra are aiming high they have thrown everything they have at the xuv700 sure it does miss on some features like paddle shifters and ventilated seats which we're used to seeing even in lower segments but then it has kit and equipment that we're used to seeing in segments way above so on the feature and equipment list it definitely has a big tick you've got a multiple choice of diesel petrol manual automatic and even all-wheel drive so yeah there's a wide variety of variants to choose from the jewel in its crown is really the power train these power trains are what bring it alive and mahindra have to be commended on the ride and handling package it has taken many leaps forward [Music] then factor in that it is spacious you can get seven seats as well and most importantly the cracking pricing m m have announced prices for four variants as of now with the rest of the optional pack and variance pricing to come later the xuv700 looks set to redefine the segment and it is surely a script to another success story for mahindra but then it has some features and equipment that we're used to seeing in segments but then but then but then that's what distracted me let me take two shots okay come back,0.30000001192092896,7.300000190734863
3,3,Zn4Ntl-AyNA,this is what we are filming today and yes as no doubt many of you will say it is an updated tuv 300 but mahindra called it the bolero neo yes they have named it after this guy over here now the bolero may be simple and basic but that would be missing the point you see it's supposed to be a rugged reliable go anywhere vehicle built to take on the rough and tumble of the country around us and it does that incredibly well just ask the thousands of owners around the country but mahindra say there's an increasing number of them that want an added layer of style and comfort and that's what they say is offered in the neo so let's take a look and begin with the style on the whole the design is more tuv but mahindra have added a few bolero elements to help with the association now over at the front yes the rectangular headlights are featured and prominently they do have a new drl signature the grille of course the typical mahindra grille is present and the bumper over here gets the kind of slatted or the sloping cuts on the lower edge moving over to the side you probably may not notice this on the camera but it does look a little shorter and that's because it is mahindra tellers they've lowered the body by about 20 mm and the bonnet another 20 mm further still now how they've done this is they've just lowered the body onto the chassis so the chassis and the ground clearance they say remains the same the alloys you get a new pattern and they look quite smart and go with the kind of upright and straight lined edges around the car one addition is this thick molding now this is a typical bolero signature which they've added bringing in that boleroness because it needs that to carry off the new nameplate now what remains as you can see is the sloping b-pillar i'm personally not a fan of it but there are people who like it it's well an aesthetic choice there is one thing though when you do open the door it tends to come a little close to your face over at the rear things are pretty similar to the tuv though the x-shaped wheel cover now carries the bolero branding the tail lights are a little different and the rest of it of course yeah you do have a spoiler atop on the higher variant and your grab handle here to open the hatch which you can see here has two jump seats they are though not the best place to sit as i have sawmill with me and we'll demonstrate [Music] so yes as you can see space at the rear is quite tight samuel and i do have to kind of adjust our feet and knees and make sure we fit here having said that though uh it is a little bit broader and just a smidge in more headroom than the regular bolero now over the regular bolero you also get these butterfly windows here which will help with ventilation having said all this though remember space isn't really the problem rather it's a matter of safety there are no seat belts and in case of a crash this isn't the right place or the position to be in so we'd suggest you use it as a boot only and stick to the seats up ahead over here at the rear or in the second row as you can see space isn't all that generous yeah i do have about a little leg room for for for me here this seat is adjusted to my driving position i'm about five foot eight and yeah there is some space underneath there too that you can tuck in your feet on the whole though it doesn't give you that sense of openness and kind of like a big suv feel the windows do do compensate for that because they offer you a very nice view outside and the sloping pillars that i didn't like of course they do help now in that they don't block or obstruct your view headroom is quite a lot and will be more than sufficient for most people and yes you do have an armrest here as well too over the regular bolero the seat cushioning is firmer and feels better and more supportive and that holds through at the front too now here at the front uh things are quite comfy the seats do feel fairly supportive and the armrests here fall to hand quite nicely and you can reach comfortably for the gear lever in terms of the dash and equipment though things are pretty similar to the tuv earlier though the ip here features a new 3.5 inch tft display the dashboard yes mahindra say it has been designed by pininfarina it does look quite nice and symmetrical and balanced uh in terms of equipment you do have the touchscreen disappointingly though it doesn't have android auto and apple carplay uh the other bits around the car yes you do have ac controls down here and you do have an eco mode for the ac this car also features a micro hybrid or a start stop technology other bits there are storage areas up here the glove box is just about okay uh there's a little pen holder and there are a few cubby holes here and that pretty much makes up the interior storage space power window switches interestingly are in the center so they're not on the doors here there's just one console for both you and the passenger as for the equipment and variants mahindra has launched three variants and the fourth that will add on a mechanically locking differential will come in a bit later i'll get to what the mechanical locking differential does at the end of the video now as far as driving the neo goes well there's a lot to expect from the engine especially since mahinda do such a fantastic job of their power trains so the engine is the familiar 1.5 liter three cylinder mhox unit and it continues to make the same amount of power and torque as the tuv did though for the bs6 norms that this car is now launched with of course they do have an evgt and that has improved the drivability just the touch bit of course it was always good and now on the neo it's that little bit better power comes in also quite early at about 1500 you get a nice strong surge and then it tapers off at about three and a half thousand and well you'd have to up shift because there's really no point going beyond 4000 in terms of refinement the engine is smooth but sound levels are quite audible inside the cabin but it's something you can look fast on this class of a vehicle as some of you would have guessed we are at the mahindra test track in pune and it's a rather small and simple one so we can't really say much about the ride and handling but the steering feel was well weighted and there seems to be a little less body roll compared to the tuv so unfortunately we can't head out of the plant and really test the bolero over the kind of terrain it would typically be used but mahindra have a small little off-road course for us over here just to simulate a bit of rough roads and harsh conditions and yes the bolero does perform expectedly quite well obviously it is a controlled environment and things are designed to make sure the bolero goes through all of them easily but in doing so it does it in a very effortless manner and quite fuss free the chassis and the suspension just takes up everything quite well and i think it should be really fine out on the rough and tumble of our roads and a little bit of the off-roads too one thing that the bolero neo does have though to help it off-road is an automatic mechanically locking differential now what that is is for example like so if i were to get one wheel up in the air and well the differential would obviously just send the power out to the wheel up in the air spinning it helplessly the differential here would lock automatically and send power to the wheel on the ground so as soon as the rpm increases there you go you have a lock and you get power so the neo is quite capable but is it a bolero for sure the bolero is a model that is rugged and it screams that out with its style and character too the neo style however does not convey the same message underneath though the neo's new generation chassis is just as tough if not tougher the engine is the same and here it puts out more power and then there's the cabin both are similar in size but the neo is just so much more refined better put together and with a load of extra equipment too and what's more is the pricing in some cities the neo is actually more affordable while in others the gap is only about 30 to 40 000 over so yes if you look past the neos exteriors you'll find quite a capable bolero underneath okay so as promised how do differentials work well in a straight line when i'm driving like this the engine power is going equally to both wheels the left and the right wheels if however i were to take a turn then the inner wheel travels a smaller part and the outer wheel needs to travel a larger part and that's where the differential comes in what it does is for instance like now it's going to be sending a little less power to the inner wheel and more to the outer wheel and it does that in a very simple fashion it's a pure mechanical device resistance on the inner wheel causes some of the power to be transferred to the outer wheel and that's it that's quite simply it very clever little device but it does create a little bit of a problem in off-road conditions there are times when you could have a wheel up in the air and the differential would just send the power to that wheel and it would spin helplessly now what you can do is you can just break that wheel and which is what is called an electronic locking differential or a brake locking differential where the brake just stops the wheel from rotating and therefore the differential sensing the resistance sends the power down to the wheel on the ground or you could also have a locking differential a mechanically locking differential which is what we have on this bolero neo interestingly you don't have to select a lever or anything it engages automatically so for example i'm gonna be getting onto an axle twister like this and now we have one wheel up in the air the outer wheel is up in the air the inner wheel is down on the ground and if i were to rev you'll see as soon as the rpm difference goes over 100 the mechanical lock will kick in and we'll have power you can actually feel that lock and that engage engagement and it's a bit harsh of course but as i said it's a mechanical device so you would probably feel the engagement and that little bit of a kick when the lock does engage,0.0,1.399999976158142
4,4,bKv2iaWN5pQ,[Music] Maruti Suzuki xl6 what this basically is is the L tiga with a new name with a new face and with a new network well actually it's the Nexen network the premium network of Maruti Suzuki where this will be sold because this car is about the LT going premium now the el tigre has been one of the stop performers for maruti it's not been a car of the year for nothing in fact this has been one of the stop performers of the entire auto industry which is down in the dumps this is probably one of the very few models the older models which has still has a pull in the market and that pull is actually towards the top end maruti also feels this car has a lot more Headroom and by that I mean not in the cabin but in the market now there's a lot of gap between this car and the Toyota Innova and that's the gap Maruti wants to fill it wants to take it closer to the Innova now that is quite a stretch but Maruti has done a fair bit to this car so we're gonna have a look at all the changes outside and inside to tell you if the Casillas car is premium enough [Music] and to make it premium Maruti has given the Excel six lots of SUV cues and from the front it actually looks quite good the grille is huge and something you won't miss the headlights with DRLs have a techy feel to them and the high bonnet along with the scuff plates in the front give the excel 6 or more macho stance you have robust scuff plates at the rear too but the SUV look is far from convincing with the LT gas huge MP we like tailgate but it's from the site that the design is really messed up and over those of cladding has knocked the xl6 proportions well for a six and has only served to dwarf the 16 inch wheels which look really puny the design now cries out for 17 inches at least well let's see what the changes are on the inside so the talking point of the xl6 are these captain seats which is what makes it a six seater and first impressions very very comfortable lots of under thigh support lower back support is also good you can recline the seat you got a retractable armrests and the overall seating position is absolutely superb because you sit in a slightly elevated way lots of outside visibility these huge windows you can see outside so overall comfort really here is fantastic if anything it doesn't have quite the width of the Innova but don't forget that the crysta is that much more expensive it's in definitely more than a class above but honestly even for large people it's so comfortable in here that for corporates this is a place they could be very very happy the seats trimmed in artificial leather have a nice double stitching and perforated finish and feel pretty upscale for an 11 lacquered MPV the all black interior themes ash wood finished inserts in the dash and the knitted roof liner at to the upmarket feel like in the air tiga you'll be surprised by the space you have in the third row and the adjustable backrest make a world of a difference practicality to is largely unchanged and you have lots of decent storage space throughout the cabin there's a useful underfloor compartment there's room for a couple of bags with all seats in place and that of course multiplies with the third row fold it down but the middle pair of captain seats don't fall like the bench seat in the edging up but what the captain seats do offer is enough room between them to let you wiggle your way to the back which at times is a more convenient way to access the third row the xl6 comes with just one engine option it's a 1.5 litre petrol which develops 105 horsepower it's carried straight off the air tiga but what is not carried over from the air tiga is the 1.5 diesel it's a shame that that fabulous 1.5 diesel does not make it into this car and a lot of you must be wondering why well there are fundamentally two reasons its cost and bandwidth because even when you have to put a diesel engine and not put any engine into a car like this it means it has to be recalibrated validation has to be done that's a costly affair and that takes up a lot of time and everyone knows marty is gonna be exiting the diesel segment so the company feels that just for a couple of months it's just not works that effort and cost to put a diesel engine in here really a shame because that is a fabulous diesel engine but this 1.5 petrol is now gone to be a 6 because that's what North is working on it's converting all this engines to be a 6 and this bs6 engine quite frankly it doesn't feel very different from the earlier LT gar it's been calibrated really well it's a smooth power delivery very linear power delivery the only issue is that it's got that same flat mid-range there's really no punch in the mid-range and that's why when you want to overtake on the highway you can't just put your foot down and it just goes forward effortlessly you need to shift down and you know floor it a bit so it's it's that's really the downside of this petrol but it's otherwise smooth and also it loves to be revved in fact you push it hard it takes a bit of a nice throaty not you know it sounds and it sounds pretty good I like it yes you do need to rev this engine to get the most out of it and you missed that surge of power in the mid-range which only a turbo engine gives you but for regular commuting this engine more than does the job so I've jumped into the automatic variant of the excel six which uses the same four speed auto carried over from the El Tigre it's a torque converter it's quite an old-school automatic so a bit lazy in its responses and it works best on our throttle you know where it can just amble along and you know as a family car in the city the xl6 auto wood is pretty good actually and even when you floor it kick down is is pretty okay it's just that with four gears it doesn't make the maximum use of this engines power and talk and even efficiency obviously won't be as good as a manual or a DCT or even AMD Auto for that matter I'm back in the manual variant which I prefer and I'm hambling happily down the Jaipur Delhi Highway where the xl6 feels quite at home there's really no difference between the xl6 and the Antigua when it comes to driving dynamics the engines are the same suspension is the same so it's got that same kind of mature ride and handling obviously not a very sporty vehicle and Peavy's aren't supposed to be but there's a nice heft to the steering which we really liked in the air tiga and we're reacquainted with that over here the ride also quite mature only the the big potholes can upset it a bit but otherwise a very plant a very mature ride in the sense that it feels very stable very secure and great for cruising and speaking about cruising the one thing the xl6 gets which the LD car doesn't have is cruise control and I'm not sure how useful that is on our roads where it's hard to keep a steady speed but yeah I mean on the tsofen stretch it's not so bad so here I have just set it it is a smidgen below 80 kph just before that annoying beep comes the speed limiter warning I'm not sure if it saved lives but it's sure as hell kill the fund the other thing the Excel six gets is Maruti Suzuki is smart play studio which is their latest infotainment system it's got some connected features which we'll have a look at in a bit the seven-inch touchscreen is fairly slick and easy to use and you can also add in Suzuki connect as an option that brings Isom based connected tech which is the new trend these days you get all the features like music streaming weather updates and more through the app you can keep a track of your driving style and send maps to your car and even geofence it but the best party trick you find in other connected cars of remotely starting the engine and turning on the aircon isn't available but let's not forget that for the price this is still a very loaded car the Excel six is essentially a spruced up version of the very capable and competent Ortega so that's a great starting point yes it does lose the superb 1.5 diesel engine but the smooth and fast free 1.5 petrol does suit the more premium character the petrol manual alpha trim is a touch pricey and is a bit of a premium to to pay for the automatics but your money does go a long way it's well equipped spacious easy to drive and very practical and if it's six seats you want this is the best car you can get for the money [Music] [Laughter],0.10000000149011612,2.9000000953674316

6,6,koknF2Dcv8I,[Music] connor golden with motor trend here in the studio with the all new 2022 hyundai ioniq 5 suv [Music] now this is hyundai's first all-electric crossover that's going to compete with the volkswagen id4 the ford mustang mach e and the probably more expensive tesla model y this is the ionic 5 but we've already got confirmation that a ionic 6 electric sedan is coming along with a larger ionic 7 3 euro suv all based on the same proprietary electric skateboard platform that the ioniq 5 rides on buyers have a choice of two motor layouts there's a single motor rear wheel drive and there's a dual motor all-wheel drive layout if you get the single motor rear wheel drive layout hyundai is aiming for a 300 mile range target now if you get your ioniq 5 in all-wheel drive dual motor setup like this ionic 5 is you get 320 horsepower and 446 pound-feet of torque and the 0-60 time drops to just under 5 seconds with the addition of a dual motor range now drops down to a targeted maximum of 269 miles all ionic 5s come equipped for 400 volt and 800 volt charging as long as you're hooked up to a 350 kilowatt charger that's a level of charging only offered by hyundai and porsche to put that into perspective when this is hooked up to a 350 kilowatt charger you go from 10 to 80 percent battery in just 18 minutes and you get 68 miles worth of charge in just five minutes one of the cooler features of the ioniq 5 is the vehicle to load capability which allows you with an adapter to plug household items and appliances into the ionic 5 something like a small fridge or in our case a paper shredder the craziest part about the ionic 5 is of course the insane retro futuristic cyberpunk 2077 blade runner 2049 kind of design vibe that's going on the first thing you'll notice are these awesome pixelated style led headlights a led design that also extends to the mirror caps and the rear tail light bar there's also this backlit grille accent bar motif that runs the length of the front grille lighting is dope but there's also some really cool aerodynamic features that extend from the front to the back of the ionic 5. this includes active airflow panels on the lower front fascia and rear fascia along with fixed airflow pass-throughs on the top of the rear deck lid check out these awesome latticeworks sunflower style wheels these wheels are complemented by an awesome angular door panel accented by a vegetable grader cyberpunky lower door plastic insert in contrast the wild retro futuristic exterior the interior is a more reserved modernist environment now that being said it is super nice in here it's nice and chock full of eco-friendly materials for example the armrests are made of recycled plastic bottles and the nice plush leather is actually a vegan leather the first thing you'll notice is the tri-level control stack on the center of the dash there's a touch capacitive panel for climate controls and there's a line of hard buttons knobs and switches for menu navigation everything else is controlled through the large infotainment screen to the right or the large digital gauge cluster sitting directly ahead of the driver another cool feature is the completely flat passenger floor that's a result of the electric skateboard platform that this ride is on a flat floor also means hyundai was able to put in a sliding adjustable center console there's also this cloth covered metal panel directly to the left of the center gauge cluster where you can stick fridge magnets on overall hugely impressed with this interior so that's the exciting all-new 2022 hyundai ioniq 5 and if you want to see more photos get some more information you got to go to motortrend.com we've got the full scoop you,0.5,2.0
7,7,wkYmKJ7nfV8,[Music] [Applause] now SUVs are really the flavor in India but one can't forget about the NPV segment which is really a great car for the big Indian family there's been a little bit of action in this segment of late with Mahindra launching the Murad so and now after six years Maruti have launched a brand new Ortega they're not deviating too much from the strengths of this car and the essential formula but this time around they've aimed to make it more desirable to the large Indian family as opposed to just fleet and taxi operators let's dive in and find out what's new [Music] the urtica has grown in length width and height and visually it does look bigger the front end now gets a sharper nose adorned with a large chrome grille the sleeker wraparound headlights amplify the width and fog lamps encased in black get a dramatic body coloured slash across the contours are all sharper the crease is more pronounced and that lends it a sporty air around the sides the c-pillar now gets styled to give it the look of a floating roof and at the rear a chrome bar extends right across there our snazzy tail lamps that look like they could be from a Volvo overall it looks well proportioned and the styling makes a dramatic difference it is the first step in making it more desirable to families instead of fleet and it definitely works the interior of the Ertiga looks much nicer now in fact when you get inside it feels a lot more premium than it was before you have a nice flat dash which is in in sort of a triple tone with the gray the wood inlay and the beige at the bottom the wood is still a little bit plasticky but honestly at this price point this still looks really good there's a nice for AC vent that runs right across the dash giving it a good amount of width you get the touchscreen infotainment you get climate control you get steering mounted controls you have nice big dials with the info display in the middle that gives you a series of functions as well the front seats are much wider now very comfortable to be in and overall this interior feels much better than before things like the leather wrap steering the cooled cupholders automatic climate control just build on the premium feel of the new interior the multi-information display emits the dials has plenty of information and even has cool displays of power and torque being used along with the regular average fuel consumption date and time the infotainment system has Android auto apple carplay and mirror link it also has inbuilt navigation there are plenty of storage areas in the door pockets for all of the rows and there is a nice flat area in front of the gear lever to store your phone as well let's also take a look at the safety features on the Ortega [Music] now the large rear doors of the article means ingress is very easy into the middle row not only that the seat is quite low so actually you can just slide in you don't even need to climb in that's a good point and now this middle row has a single touch tilt and slide functions so getting in to this third row is also much much easier now now I'm five foot four and as you can see even with the middle row all the way back I'm still quite comfortable I fit in quite easily I'm a little knees up but I can stretch my feet under this middle row so you know I can be here for a considerable amount of time on this journey I have the cup holder I have the charger I have quite a large window area so honestly this third row is a big improvement from before the rear seat also has a recline function which means third row passengers can really get comfortable but what does that mean for the boot space now when one's buying a larger car of course boot space is important and in this one even with the third row up you have a reasonable amount of space you can fit three Strohl even here quite comfortably and there's this cool storage area underneath the boot at the back where you can actually keep some parcels keep it hidden so if you parked your car and you want to go somewhere it's a nice storage area it has the split lid so it's convenient to access as well and of course once you flip down the seats you can open up more room [Music] all the variants were on offer to drive and I opted for the popular people's choice first the diesel the 1.3 litre Fiat sauced engine that has 90 HP and 200 ml for now initial impression from behind the wheel is you know that it seems quite car like actually to drive now because of this flat - and it gives you great visibility but it's got a nice high seating position so it gives you the commanding feel as well now this engine is one that's been around a long while for Maruti it's the tried and tested diesel it's now feeling quite old and it continues in this Ortega it's noisy it has the same characteristics as before there is a bit of lag you do have to work the gears to get it going and power kicks in really after about 2000 rpm you have to really walk this engine to get to triple digit speeds once there it cruises comfortably however overtakes do require gear changes especially if you're fully loaded other than that the clutch is light and easy the gearbox has a short positive throw and is light enough to use as well so overall drive in a relaxed manner and it feels just fine it just doesn't like to be hard the steering has more heft now and overall the car just feels more solid more stable more planted whether you're going around the corners or whether it's higher speeds in a straight line your feels more impressive now and out on the road it actually gives you the feeling of being a bigger MPD after finding out what it was like to drive it was time to hop over to the backseat to see what it's like for the passengers the increased dimensions can be felt here in the backseat you have more room there's more legroom the bench is wider so a third passenger will fit in very very easily and of course the flat floorboard means third passenger has enough legroom as well these large windows make it nice and open and airy you sit high you've got good visibility to the front and of course you've got the blower's here for the rear seat a little close to the head but fact of the matter is they will keep you cool well space is one of the things that's necessary to be comfortable in the back seat what's also important is the right quality now the right quality of the Ertiga is actually quite good there's a bit of underlying firmness when the cars empty but when it's fully loaded that goes away just absorbs bumps and potholes really well so overall you know with the space and a good ride quality this back seat is a very comfortable place to be in the Artic I was taking all the right boxes and next up I hopped into the petrol which has the K 15 1.5 litre that we have seen in the ciass the petrol has two variants a manual and an auto but we focused on the auto since its new now I'm in the petrol Auto that's right the Ertiga gets an auto box now it's a 4-speed and it actually works quite well shifting quite smoothly gentle dabs on the throttle bring up down shifts and they happen quite quickly so the gearbox works really well you have the different modes that you can use when it is in overdrive mode even gentle dab on the throttle will bring up a downshift because it's generally shifting gears up much quicker and keeping you driving in a very economical manner however switch the overdrive off and then it pulls much more stronger in each gear and it doesn't shift every time you accelerate a bit you also have the low mode where if I extend my foot it'll just keep pulling and pulling and pulling and won't shift till I want to a handy feature if you're traveling with a full load maybe up a hill and you want to hold the gear the petrol engine is silent at idle and feels refined enough at low revs but once you press hard down on the throttle then it does become portable this petrol engine feels pretty similar to what it does in the sea as it pulls off the line cleanly and it's got a bit of a flat mid-range but overall it gets up to triple digit speeds quite nicely easy driving in a relaxed manner without pushing it too hard and honestly it does really well and overall it feels like the better of the two engines overall the Ortega has grown and it feels like a far more mature product now the article has retained some of the weaknesses that Arad earlier like the diesel engine and even the petrol is really not exciting but though lackluster both engines do the job and they easy enough to drive and let's face it this segment is far more about practicality than it is about anything else and that is where the Ertiga really scores big the interiors have grown and are more spacious now of course it has that 7 seater option the integers feel more premium you get more features and it was always a comfortable car to be in so now it's more appealing to the personal buyer and of course the Ertiga is great value as well the fact remains that for the large Indian family there isn't a seven-seater that is this premium and this practical at this price point [Music] [Laughter],0.6000000238418579,5.199999809265137
8,8,zE_iqWzEI44,[Music] tata's nexon has always been one of its most successful products now this facelift with even more kit on the inside and a petrol engine that has 10 horsepower more promises to take it to the next level just how good is it let's take a look but first up the new look which frankly is a big departure from the earlier one in fact it's so thoroughly updated from some angles it looks like much more than a mere facelift a lot of this is down to the larger looking nose it now gets a higher suv like bonnet the large c-shaped bracket makes it look wider and with the integrated bulba and the force cuff plate the chin is now more suv two around the side the white ceramic highlights are a signature of the nexon and help define the rising belt line and it now gets black in c pillars to make it less coupe like the new union jack tail lights look interesting and with nexon now written across the rear it's easy to identify this one as the facelift it even gets four vents at the bottom of the rear bumper to make it look wider the cabin is more familiar but still substantially updated so quite a lot new on the inside first up is this dry arrow design that comes right across the dash there's this new steering wheel the flat bottom steering wheel cruise control is new you get this new instrument panel a digital instrument panel and a new sunroof while the build of the dash feels tough and the buttons are well finished the oversized drive mode knob is a waste of space tata could have easily used it to install something practical like a cup holder strange thing is there still isn't a secure place to put your phone there's a lot of hard edges here it's a tight fit and even when you roll back these blinds these roller blinds there's more angles and places your phone is likely to get damaged so the safest place is to keep it in your pocket also both the instrument panel and the touchscreen need to be brighter try and reverse in full sunshine and it is genuinely difficult to see obstacles on the screen still the umbrella holders in the doors are a nice touch the big cooled glove box is well cool and then there's the even cooler express cool function express cooling on windows may roll down it even reminds you to put the window up via a voice prompt when the cabin is finally cooling nicely the nexon has always been a comfortable suv to sit in this in part is due to the space efficient design and the ruby wide cabin and it's pretty good in the rear as well so surprisingly comfortable in the back especially due to this long seat this long swab gives you tremendous thigh support there's a fair amount of knee room you can keep your feet under the seat you have a vent here for you and despite the arched roof there's a decent amount of headroom as well there are no usb ports in the back however and that's something tata could have fixed the nexon also gets tata's ira connected tech and included in this software suite is the what three words navigation aid we didn't manage to test either however as the various functions weren't activated when it comes to kit you also get led drls both at the front and the rear you now get esps sander there's also traction control rollover mitigation brake assist auto wipers auto lights and tire pressure monitoring luggage space in the rear is a useful 350 liters and you can fold and flip the seats down as well [Music] tata's 1.2 petrol may be a three cylinder engine but the only time you can really tell is when you fire it up the nexon petrol is also a bit smoother now tata have retuned this engine to make it a bit more powerful and importantly to make it smoother the earlier one was extremely snatchy and here to some small extent it has succeeded but it still feels a bit jerky when you get on and off the throttle there also is quite some amount of lag put your foot down at around 1000 rpm and you have to wait till well over 2000 for it to really start pulling strongly and that at times in city traffic can be difficult the engine does a fair job in the mid-range there is a fair amount of performance in the mid-range and if you keep it there the nexon pulls forward quite smartly but pulling it to the 6000 rpm redline doesn't really make much sense it's noisy it feels strained and the amount of extra performance you gain isn't all that much question is can you feel the additional 10 horsepower only at times and if you'd really pay attention and let's not forget the nexon is heavy especially compared to many of its rivals the driving modes eco city and sport work quite well eco is ok when you want to conserve fuel and spot does give you an extra kick while we did do a performance test we weren't able to launch the new nexon cleanly as the traction control couldn't be switched off and as a result to 0-100 came up in 13.01 seconds ignore the launch however and it clearly shows this new one has a bit of an edge over the earlier 110 horsepower version with the nexon really excels is over broken roads you can carry on over bad patches often without really having to slow down overall the nexon does round off the bumps pretty nicely but there still is a bit of stiffness in the springs and over broken patches of road and large craters you can feel that what it does however is give the nexon good straight line stability and this delivers plenty of confidence through to the steering the little bit of stiffness in the suspension helps the nexon in the handling department too with its well-weighted steering and actually decent body control the nexon feels comfortable at speed it isn't as agile as something like an eco sport but get onto a good road and you can certainly enjoy slinging a few corners together with its uprated and recalibrated engine the 2020 nexon now feels marginally peppier and smoother to drive its beefy suspension does well in our conditions it is among the more spacious and comfortable compact suvs in its class and with the additional goodies and kit on offer it now feels more up market too also with prices ranging from 6.95 to 11.20 lakh for the petrol the nexon is still great value for money no quality levels still aren't quite the same as some rivals and the petrol engine and gearbox need to be even smoother still if you are among the many who think this is the best looking car in its class and are looking for a comfortable compact suv that's adept at taking on our roads and is well equipped the new 2020 nexon is the one you need to keep on your shortlist [Laughter] you,0.20000000298023224,3.0
