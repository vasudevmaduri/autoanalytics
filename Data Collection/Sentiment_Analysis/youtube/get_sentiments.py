text = "gentle music gentle upbeat music rhythmic upbeat music Whats up guys Saf here on SuperSaf TV and in this video were going to be doing a detailed comparison between the OnePlus 8 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra Weve got the best from OnePlus as well as the best from Samsung Well compare all of the key differences as well as some image samples SuperSaf style So lets initially look at the built and design Now both devices are very premium Weve got a metal frame with curved glass bowls on the front and the back and both devices are also IP 68 water and dust resistant The S20 Ultra does however only come in two options and they are both glossy Weve got a cosmic black and a cosmic gray which we see here So its pretty plain and we also have this pretty large rectangular camera module The OnePlus 8 Pro comes in this frosted finish of this glacial green which we have here Theres also a glossy onyx black as well as an ultramarine blue which is currently not available in the UK The camera module is central lined Now looking at these both side by side I would have to say that the OnePlus 8 Pro does have a better design in my opinion I do like the central line camera module which makes things symmetrical I also really like this frosted matte glass finish which attracts less fingerprints and it also has this really cool effect depending on the way the light hits it Now in either case you can customize the look of these devices with a skin from our channels sponsor dbrand theyve got a huge variety and you can swap things around once you get too bored as well My personal favorite now is the teardown series which is made in partnership with my good friend Zack from JerryRigEverything If youre interested in picking up a skin then theres going to be a link in the description below Now Im looking at the differences in terms of the size Both are large devices but the S20 Ultra is slightly larger in the height the width as well as the thickness Its also around 20 21 grams heavier But both devices are large and thats because they have large displays Now both displays are really really good These are some of the best displays out there right now Weve got minimal bezels with a punchout Now I would say that the S20 Ultra does have a slightly smaller bezel on the top but theyre very very similar Both displays also curve from the sides However the OnePlus 8 Pro is a bit more curved on the sides in comparison to the S20 Ultra Now the OnePlus 8 Pro has a 678 inch display The S20 Ultra has a slightly larger 69 inch display Both of these are using AMOLED technology Both have up to a Quad HD resolution and both also supports a 120 Hertz refresh rate with 240 Hertz of touch input But there is a little bit of a catch On the S20 Ultra you can only have the 120 Hertz refresh rate If youre at Full HD you cannot have this at Quad HD Now this seems to be to save on battery life but on the OnePlus 8 Pro you do have that option So if you do want to go all out and absolutely kill your battery you can do that And I like that this option is here because maybe you do want that very high resolution as well as that high refresh rate and this is an advantage that the OnePlus 8 Pro has The OnePlus 8 Pro also has MEMC technology so thats motion estimation and motion compensation This is essentially going to take content thats at a standard prime rate say 25 30 frames a second and make it seem as though its at a higher frame rate by applying motion smoothness and things like that This is something that you may or may not like It is supported across lots of popular apps such as Amazon Prime Video Netflix as well as YouTube Now generally speaking I dont think you can go wrong with either of these displays they are some of the best displays out there The OnePlus 8 Pro you are getting that advantage of Quad HD with a 120 Hertz On the S20 Ultra youre getting a center punchout which I do personally prefer a little bit to the side punchout here on the OnePlus 8 Pro And the display is also a little bit flatter compared to the very curved display of the OnePlus 8 Pro Now another thing is that the S20 Ultra does have an AlwaysOn Display which is something that I personally find really useful You can just see things at a glance The OnePlus 8 Pro unfortunately still does not have this Im sure it can come with a software update but currently and its state right now it is not there unfortunately Now both devices do have an indisplay fingerprint scanner which is very very fast However the technology is quite different The OnePlus 8 Pro has an optical indisplay fingerprint scanner The S20 Ultra has an ultrasonic indisplay fingerprint scanner So the technology is superior on the S20 Ultra It is actually measuring the ridges in your fingers However the OnePlus 8 Pro can be a little bit faster I have found Now one thing that I dont like on the OnePlus 8 Pro is that you do have to wake the device before you can use the fingerprint scanner So there is an extra step involved You have to either tap to wake it then press it or lift the device to wake it Whereas on the S20 Ultra it is always on and you can just tap in this area whenever and its going to unlock your device So I know a lot of people do praise OnePlus devices for the fingerprint scanner and how fast it is but for me that extra step actually makes it slower So I do personally prefer the ultrasonic indisplay fingerprint scanner on the S20 Ultra Now lets talk about the cameras Well start with the frontfacing cameras You can see here that we do have the punchouts The S20 Ultra does have a high resolution as well as a wider aperture And you can see some samples here I think both of them do a pretty good job overall I do find that the OnePlus 8 Pro does still overexpose for selfies This is something that Ive noticed on previous OnePlus devices as well It does make you look a little bit fairer compared to how you actually are The S20 Ultra although its not my favorite selfie camera and it can still lighten your skin a little bit I would still prefer it overall to the OnePlus 8 Pro And also for video because the OnePlus 8 Pro can only film at 180p from the frontfacing camera at 30 frames a second The S20 Ultra can film at up to 4K 60 frames a second from the frontfacing camera So for those reasons the edge does go to the S20 Ultra for the frontfacing camera but things are quite interesting when we look at the rearfacing cameras So we do have a Quad camera setup on both of these The three main cameras are similar in the sense that weve got an ultrawide camera weve got a primary camera and then weve got a telephoto camera which is going to give optical zoom The fourth camera is different The S20 Ultra has a Time of Flight sensor which is going to help with depth information The OnePlus 8 Pro has a color filer camera which Im still a little bit confused about Im not sure what the exact use of this is because as far as I can see a lot of the filters that you get on there you can actually apply in a post anyway but nevertheless its there Now you can see a few samples here the primary cameras Id say are very good on both for most situations They do have good dynamic range overall and good colors For the ultrawide cameras I think both do a good job The S20 Ultra is slightly wider which I do prefer And for the telephoto cameras the S20 Ultra does have much more optical zoom So you can get in much closer to you subjects and this is a lot more noticeable when you go to the likes of 10 times up to 30 times Now I know it does seem 100X here on the S20 Ultra but you guys probably already know how I feel about this Its not really practical its not really usable Im not sure why Samsung have plastered 100X on here when it is at this level Its fine to have and you dont need to use it but Samsung dont plaster it on the freaking device Now for low light it was quite interesting because in certain situations I did prefer the S20 Ultra in certain situations I preferred the OnePlus 8 Pro Here you can see an outdoor shot The S20 Ultra for me is a lot better theres a lot of processing happening on the OnePlus 8 Pros shot But on this indoor shot I did prefer the OnePlus 8 Pro which did better maintain the colors and the detail compared to the S20 Ultra The OnePlus 8 Pro also has a macro mode which lets you get in super upclose using the ultrawide camera This is something you dont have on the S20 Ultra Now for video both did seem to do a good job One area where the OnePlus 8 Pro is definitely better is in autofocus This is something that the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra has struggle with even after numerous updates It just doesnt have that dual pixel autofocus which Samsung has been known for for a long time and it can struggle a lot of times with focus The OnePlus 8 Pro is definitely faster and better here And rearfacing cameras We can switch to ultrawide on both And we can also zoom Its three times on the OnePlus 8 Pro and theres five times on the S20 Ultra The S20 Ultra however does offer 8K video Now this is a great add It does crop in quite heavily and you do lose some stabilization and things but its definitely a nice option to have if you do want to play around with it This is something thats not available on the OnePlus 8 Pro Now of course this is not a detailed SuperSaf style camera comparison I just wanted to show you a few image and video samples I will hopefully do some more in detail camera test when the lockdown is over Right now I can pretty much just shoot in and around my house which is quite limiting Now lets talk about the performance So the OnePlus 8 Pro it is all about speed It does come with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 chip set along with the X55 modem for 5G The S20 Ultra it comes in two options So you guys may already know about this but depending on your region youre going to get either the same the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 or you might get the Exynos 990 Now you may have seen loads of YouTubers talk about this including myself The Exynos chip set unfortunately is just not as good as the 865 when it comes to performance but more so when it comes to power efficiency The 865 is just better in my experience Unfortunately you dont have a choice about this So depending on your region the OnePlus 8 Pro might actually be the faster devices or it might be quite equal This is something that you know hopefully Samsung will improve over time and have some more consistency I just like if they went all out on the 865 but hey lets see For storage you do have a base of 128 gigabytes UFS 30 The S20 Ultra is available in a 512 gigabyte version The OnePlus 8 Pro is also available in a 256 byte option For RAM the S20 Ultra does come with more RAM straight off the back So youve got 12 gigabytes of RAM as a base youve got up to 16 gigabytes The OnePlus 8 Pro comes in either eight or 12 gigabytes of RAM And now in speed and performance generally speaking both of these are going to be really really good The S20 Ultra does get one advantage and that is that it does have a micro SD card slot so you can expand the storage here on the S20 Ultra You cannot expand the storage on the OnePlus 8 Pro The OnePlus 8 Pro also comes as default with dual SIM functionality so thats great The S20 Ultra again this is going to vary depending on your region Some regions do have dual SIM others do not Now lets talk about the software So both devices do have Android 10 out of the box and they come with their own skins So on the OnePlus 8 Pro we do have OxygenOS The S20 Ultra comes with OneUI Now realistically speaking these are some of my favorite skins They are my top two theyre very clean very functional and they also do add features that you dont get as defaults on stock Android So Im very happy with both of these A lot of it is going to come down to your personal preference One advantage that I have to give to the OnePlus 8 Pro is that OnePlus is really really good with updates They do generally provide updates much faster than the likes of Samsung as well as many others So if updates are important to you then the OnePlus 8 Pro is going to be a great option Now for speakers both devices do have stereo speakers Weve got one bottomfiring and then weve got one in the earpiece Both sound really really good And now lets talk about the batteries So the S20 Ultra does have a larger battery and in my usage its been really good However this is once again going to come down to your region The Exynos version is not as power efficient which means Im getting around 20 less battery life on my Exynos version compared to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 And I am generally getting over six hours of screenon time on a regular basis So Ive been very very happy with the S20 Ultra Now bear in mind this is Full HD at a 120 Hertz with the Qualcomm version Ive not have the OnePlus 8 Pro long enough as yet to give you a proper conclusion of battery life Generally speaking it has been pretty good for me and does get me through the day For charging both of these do support very fast charging out of the box however you do get a slightly faster charger with the OnePlus 8 Pro compared to the S20 Ultra However you can buy a 45 Watt charger separately which is going to charge up the S20 Ultra very very fast And the OnePlus 8 Pro for the first time on a OnePlus device does have wireless charging This is something that Ive been asking for for a very very long time And not only that its also very very fast compared to the S20 Ultra The S20 Ultra is around 15 Watts and the OnePlus 8 Pro is going towards 30 Watts So youre getting from one to 50 in just 30 minutes This is wireless charging so its something that Im very very happy to see here on the OnePlus 8 Pro And both devices do support reverse wireless charging So this is where you can use the devices to charge maybe some accessories or something wirelessly Now the S20 Ultra here does get the advantage because it does have faster reverse wireless charging compared to the OnePlus 8 Pro The OnePlus 8 Pro also has a new feature which OnePlus have introduced and that is smart charging optimization which is supposed to give your battery a longer lifespan overtime And what this essentially does is it delays your charging based on you usage pattern So say for instance you wake up at 800 am every day then its not going to charge your device to really 100 until you wake up and this way it should help your battery health in the long term Now lets talk about the price The OnePlus 8 Pro has gone up in price compared to the previous generation something weve been seeing from OnePlus year and year again So it is starting at around 900 The S20 Ultra however does start much higher at around 1400 or around 1200 pounds here in the UK So you are going to be paying quite a bit more for the S20 Ultra compared to the OnePlus 8 Pro And the OnePlus 8 Pro lets be real is the better overall deal here You are getting a lot of features for that price The S20 Ultra is a really good device and it is offering some unique features such as that extensive zoom but is it worth that higher price tag What do you guys think Definitely let me know in the comments below Also let me know which device you would pick overall the OnePlus 8 Pro or the S20 Ultra Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra If you want to
